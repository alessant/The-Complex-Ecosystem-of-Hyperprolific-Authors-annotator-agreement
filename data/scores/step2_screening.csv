The objectives are to identify the most productive research institutions and researchers, the research themes at these institutions, the output and impact of the research carried out and the most prolific authors. A search on the Scopus database identified 1,668 articles published during this period. The results indicate that research output was primarily from the five public research universities reflecting their privileged funding model and that output had increased rapidly in recent years. Topics of research were broad ranging from materials and structures in the engineering field, to the more conventional construction management and building science topics. Although numerous authors from Malaysia have high citation counts and h-indices, the overall impact of the research was low with many articles either published in low impact journals or received few citations. There is evidence of publication inflation where the increase in publication counts have not been matched by a comparable increase in citation counts. National innovation or research funding policies must rigorously address both the quantity and quality of research outputs to accurately assess impact. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2019."

Norepinephrine (NE) is an essential component of catecholamine induced by emotional arousal, and numerous studies have demonstrated that NE is a key regulator in memory enhancement. We therefore conducted a bibliometric analysis to represent the knowledge pattern of the literature on the theme of NE-memory relationship. Methods: The WOSCC database was selected to extract literature published during 2003-2022. The collected data of annual production, global cooperation, research structure and hotspots were analyzed and visualized. Results: Our results showed that research on the links between NE and memory displayed a considerable development trend over the last two decades. The USA had a leading position in terms of scientific outputs and collaborations. Meanwhile, University of California Irvine contributed the most publications. Benno Roozendaal and James McGaugh were the most prolific authors in this field, and Neurobiology of Learning and Memory had the highest number of publications on this topic. The research emphasis has evolved from memory-related diseases and brain regions to neural mechanisms for different types of memory at neural circuit levels. Conclusion: Our bibliometric analysis systematically analyzed the literature on the links between NE and memory from a bibliometric perspective. The demonstrated results of the knowledge mapping would provide valuable insights into the global research landscape. Copyright © 2023 Song and Tan."

Thus, it is imperative to highlight the available evidence to help promote red meat as part of a well-balanced diet to optimize human health. In this study, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to investigate the current research status of dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, and anserine with metabolic syndrome, identify research hotspots, and delineate developmental trends by utilizing the visualization software CiteSpace. A total of 1094 publications were retrieved via the Web of Science Core Collection from 1992 to 2022. There exists a gradual increase in the number of publications on this topic, but there is still much room for research papers to rise. The United States has participated in the most studies, followed by China and Japan. The University of Sao Paulo was the research institute contributing the most; Kyung Ja Chang and Sanya Roysommuti have been identified as the most prolific authors. The analysis of keywords reveals that obesity, lipid profiles, blood pressure, and glucose metabolism, as well as ergogenic aid and growth promoter have been the research hotspots.

The aim of the research was to examine how the SFCE developed from 1995 to 2022. For this purpose, the method of bibliometric analysis was used in this study. This systematic literature review examined 537 articles published in CSSCI, CSCD, and PKU databases. The literature was analyzed with regards to the distribution of publications by year, author, institution/organization and journal. Additionally, visual maps were created with analyses of coauthor, co-words and thematic clusters from COOC and VOSviewer. The results show that SFCE has become a compelling issue. However, the publications in the national academic community were small. The most prolific authors were found to be Lin Jinhui, Guo Qiang, and Liu Mengjin. It was also found that the Xiamen University Educational Institute was the most productive institution and China Adult Education was the top journal in SFCE research. As a result of the bibliometric analysis, there is little cooperation between scientists and institutions in the field of SFCE. According to the co-words and thematic cluster analysis, five main clusters were formed. In the future, in-depth research on vocational education, Sino-Foreign Cooperative universities and countermeasures under the epidemic will become the new trend. A mixed research approach should be more adopted in the research methodology, and the research perspective from different interest subjects should be expanded in the future. © The Author(s) 2023."

Different techniques have been adopted in this regard, and many review papers have addressed them either qualitatively or quantitatively through bibliometric analysis. Nevertheless, none of these review studies conducted a general dynamic quantitative analysis of the vast amount of scientific literature about heritage buildings preservation (HBP) research domain over time. Therefore, the current study performs a bibliometric analysis of the relevant literature considering a time of two decades (2002–2022). A total of 863 peer-reviewed journal articles were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. A five-step methodology was followed employing VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Biblioshiny as the bibliometric software tools. The main findings revealed the annual publication trends and the most prominent articles. It was also found that 60% of the literature publications were published in journals, and only 2.4% corresponded to review studies. The scientific collaboration networks showed the most prolific researchers and countries. Further, the citation analysis of journals identified the most reliable information sources for academic researchers. Finally, the conceptual and intellectual knowledge structures were visualised and studied via science mapping analysis to map the research domain evolution and determine its trending patterns and promising areas for future exploration. The conducted review provides fellow researchers with a systematic summarised database to be familiarized with the HBP literature and identify potential research opportunities to conduct state-of-the-art research with the top contributors in the field (researchers, journals, and countries). In addition, policymakers can utilize the results from this research to find expert authors and academic support to facilitate forming partnerships to plan and fund relevant research and address the practical implications of preserving valuable heritage buildings. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Over the years, global research on mercury poison has soared owing to concerns about its effects on human health, occupational safety, and environmental sustainability. Although numerous studies have identified and examined the various types, sources, toxicity, exposure, and impacts of mercury, comprehensive studies on the research landscape and scientific developments on the subject areas are currently lacking. Therefore, this paper shows a bibliometric analysis (BA) and literature review (LR) of the top publications, funders, organisations, and countries working on Mercury research worldwide. Methods: The research landscape on the subject area was examined by BA from 1995 to 2021, whereas the scientific developments were highlighted through literature review. Results: Results showed that mercury research has gained global prominence since the discovery of the Minamata disease in 1956. The most prolific mercury researchers, institutions, and funders are from the United States, Japan, Brazil, Canada, and China, whereas the publications on Mercury research doubled over the period. The top source titles for publications on Mercury are Neurotoxicology, Science of the Total Environment, and Environmental Health Perspectives. However, Micheal Aschner (US) and Takashi Yorifuji (Japan) are the most prolific researchers. Co-occurrence analysis revealed that mercury, methyl mercury, fish, toxicity, and Minamata disease are the most cited keywords, which shows the correlation nexus between fish consumption and mercury poisoning. Conclusion: The LR showed that mercury research is widely investigated due to global concerns about its impact on human health, safety, and the environment. © 2022 The authors."

This study evaluates the research productivity of microwave-assisted transesterification technology for biodiesel production using various bibliometric indicators. Using relevant keywords search, data were extracted from the Scopus database. Visualization of similarities viewer (VOSviewer) software v1.6.18 was then used for network visualisation and various bibliometric analysis. The study shows that microwave-assisted transesterification technology is still in its early stages when compared to other biodiesel production technologies. Despite the fact that its potential was first highlighted in 2004, the first study on its application was published in 2007. However, it was not until 2010 that several researchers became interested in this technology. The most productive countries in publications, existing collaborations and cooperation, top institutions in publications, and top journals have been identified and presented. Finally, keyword co-occurrence analysis of the subject, as well as the most prolific researchers and the highest referenced publications in the field, were presented and discussed.

This paper presents the research landscape and scientific developments on safety culture in the global construction industry. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was employed to identify, screen, and analyze the published documents indexed in the Elsevier Scopus database. Next, the research landscape and scientific developments on the topic were examined by bibliometric analysis (BA) through co-authorship, keywords co-occurrence, and citations. Results: Results showed that 738 documents were published and indexed on the topic between 1995 and 2020. The findings showed that articles are the preferred medium, whereas Engineering is the preferred subject theme for published documents on the topic. The journal of Safety Science (published by Elsevier) is the most influential source of publications on the topic. In contrast, Dongping Fang, based at Tsinghua University (China), is the most influential researcher due to the substantial research grants and financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation. Further analysis showed that the most prolific authors on the topic are based in China, Australia, and Indonesia, although the United States has published the most documents. BA also revealed large networks of researchers and co-occurring keywords and the organisations and countries that currently exist, collaborate, and cite each other works on the topic. Conclusion: The findings indicate that safety culture in the global construction industry has undergone significant scientific developments resulting in high research impact mainly due to its role in preserving the health and safety of workers.

Based on the keywords clustering analysis, biochar applications in “bioenergy production”, “global climate change mitigation”, “salinity and drought stress amelioration”, “organic pollutants degradation”, “heavy metals immobilization”, and “bioremediation” were the main hotspots. Biochar for salinity and drought stress amelioration became the focus in biochar area in 2020 as biochar amendment had great potential in alleviating salt- and drought-affected soils. Organic pollutants’ degradation via advanced oxidation process (AOPs) represents a sustainable growing topic. Radical and non-radical pathways were summarized for AOPs. Bioremediation using functional bacteria (e.g., heavy metal-resistant bacteria and organic pollutant-degraders) immobilized on biochar was still a research hotspot. Immobilized cells showed excellent performance in removing various contaminants by combining the advantages of highly efficient physiochemical sorption of biochar and microbial metabolisms.

School nurses are the professionals who, with their expertise in health promotion and education, can facilitate this literacy throughout the educational process. Purpose: To analyze the scientific production in HL in childhood and adolescence in the last two decades, and to determine the involvement of professionals in this field, with emphasis on nursing professionals. Methods: A bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature (from 2000 to 2021) of articles retrieved from the Web of Science database was carried out. Original articles in all languages were considered as inclusion criteria. Bibliometrix 3.1.4 package from RStudio and VOSviewer were used to analyze publications and explain main results about citations, authors, countries, keywords trends, evolution, clusters of related terms, and professionals’ involvement. Results: A total of 2032 articles were included in the analysis. The results of the analysis showed that both publications and citations increased substantially since 2014. The most prolific authors in this field are not the most cited so far. The countries that published the most during the period evaluated were the United States, Australia and Canada. The keyword clusters identified in this scientometric study made it possible to determine hotspots in the study of HL in childhood and adolescence, with “mental health” being one of the main terms identified. There are different health-related professionals who are publishing in this field; in spite of this, nurses are not visible as authors in the publications. Conclusion: The scientific literature on HL in childhood and adolescence is a growing field in which different professionals are involved. Despite the increase in the number of publications, and despite the role that nurses play in schools regarding HL, their presence in scientific production is practically nonexistent. © 2023 The Authors"

But the cardiovascular damage caused by the new coronavirus is unknown. We have analyzed the current global scenario and the general pattern of growth. After summarizing the known relationship between cardiovascular diseases and new coronary pneumonia, relevant articles are analyzed through bibliometrics and visualization. Methods: Following our pre-designed search strategy, we selected publications on COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease in the Web of Science database. In our relevant bibliometric visualization analysis, a total of 7,028 related articles in the WOS core database up to 20th October 2022 were summarized, and the most prolific authors, the most prolific countries, and the journals and institutions that published the most articles were summarized and quantitatively analyzed. Results: SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and has significant involvement in the cardiovascular system in addition to pulmonary manifestations, with a difference of 10.16% (20.26%/10.10%) in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. The number of cases increases in winter and decreases slightly in summer with temperature changes, but the increase in cases tends to break out of seasonality across the region as mutant strains emerge. The co-occurrence analysis found that with the progress of the epidemic, the research keywords gradually shifted from ACE2 and inflammation to the treatment of myocarditis and complications, indicating that the research on the new crown epidemic has entered the stage of prevention and treatment of complications. Conclusion: When combined with the current global pandemic trend, how to improve prognosis and reduce human body damage could become a research focus. At the same time, timely detection, prevention, and discovery of new mutant strains have also become key tasks in the fight against the epidemic, and full preparations have been made to prevent the spread of the next wave of mutant strains, and still need to continue to pay attention to the differential performance of the variant “omicron.” Copyright © 2023 Cheng, Ren, Ma, Alam, Jia and Liu."

Objective: This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research conducted in recent decades on immune checkpoint blockade for melanoma, while exploring research trends and public interest in this topic. Methods: We summarized the articles in the Web of Science Core Collection on immune checkpoint blockade for melanoma in each year from 1999 to 2020. The R package bibliometrix was used for data extraction and visualization of the distribution of publication year and the top 10 core authors. Keyword citation burst analysis and cocitation networks were calculated with CiteSpace. A Gunn online world map was used to evaluate distribution by country and region. Ranking was performed using the Standard Competition Ranking method. Coauthorship analysis and co-occurrence were analyzed and visualized with VOSviewer. Results: After removing duplicates, a total of 9169 publications were included. The distribution of publications by year showed that the number of publications rose sharply from 2015 onwards and either reached a peak in 2020 or has yet to reach a peak. The geographical distribution indicated that there was a large gap between the number of publications in the United States and other countries. The coauthorship analysis showed that the 149 top institutions were grouped into 8 clusters, each covering approximately a single country, suggesting that international cooperation among institutions should be strengthened. The core author extraction revealed changes in the most prolific authors. The keyword analysis revealed clustering and top citation bursts. The cocitation analysis of references from 2010 to 2020 revealed the number of citations and the centrality of the top articles. Conclusions: This study revealed trends in research and public interest in immune checkpoint blockade for melanoma. Our findings suggest that the field is growing rapidly, has several core authors, and that the United States is taking the lead position. Moreover, cooperation between countries should be strengthened, and future research hot spots might focus on deeper exploration of drug mechanisms, prediction of treatment efficacy, prediction of adverse events, and new modes of administration, such as combination therapy, which may pave the way for further research. © Yantao Xu, Zixi Jiang, Xinwei Kuang, Xiang Chen, Hong Liu."

It is observed that value co-creation has been analyzed mainly from a perspective of marketing or services. The interest of studying value co-creation in relation to innovation is growing but there are no previous literature reviews that focus on the literature that studies value co-creation from a technology and innovation management perspective. The present research aims to close this gap. This research has two aims. First, we make a descriptive analysis of the evolution of documents published from 2004 to 2020. We analyze the main journals and identify the most prolific authors. In addition, we observe collaborative behavior at three different levels – country, institution, and author. Second, we determine the content structure of this literature through a bibliographic coupling analysis, and characterize the resulting groups. As a result of this analysis, we describe eleven thematic groups and characterize them through different metrics. Based on these metrics and the previous analysis, we classify and explain the studies about co-creation in the technology and innovation management field. We obtained three research streams: open innovation, consumer-centric analysis, and service ecosystem and service innovation, and two new trends: servitization and the sharing economy. © Copyright © 2020 Nájera-Sánchez, Ortiz-de-Urbina-Criado and Mora-Valentín."

This study gives a bibliometric overview of original research articles on medical informatics and telemedicine indexed in Scopus, PubMed, and Science Direct over the last 20 years in sub-Saharan Africa. Keywords related to health informatics and telemedicine were used to retrieve relevant literature. We specifically analyzed the evolution, standard metrics, domains of medical informatics (MI) and TM in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRIC) nations. Our results identified mhealth as the main field of research in telemedicine that has seen significant growth in both BRIC and SSA nations and is poised to be the focus of research activity in the near future. Research production in mhealth and telemedicine showed a considerable increase from 1999–2018. The production was dominated by articles from South Africa in Africa and China from the BRIC nations. Most prolific authors have resources and are leaders of health informatics projects. The production came from 26 sub-Saharan African countries, denoting this field’s devotion in different areas around sub-Sahara.

However, the performance of the published literature in terms of the scientific impact and gaining social media attention remains largely unexplored. The scientific literature of open innovation was examined by means of bibliometric analyses to identify the most prolific authors, organizations, countries, journals, research areas, and recurring terms. By accessing the Web of Science Core Collection and Altmetric electronic databases, citation-related and Altmetric data were evaluated. Public-private partnerships and a selection of newly introduced potential novel drugs in the analyzed publications were identified. North America and Europe were the major literature contributors. Research outputs were mainly published in journals focused on business and economics, pharmacology and pharmacy, and engineering. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies contributed to the analyzed publications, with higher mean citation counts and social media attention (Altmetric score) than nonindustry articles. Public-private partnerships fostered financial support, sharing of expertise and intellectual property, and research collaborations. In summary, open innovation might serve as a powerful strategy to both benefit the involved industry entities and accelerate the development of solutions and products for the betterment of human health. © Copyright © 2021 Yeung, Atanasov, Sheridan, Klager, Eibensteiner, Völkl-Kernsock, Kletecka-Pulker, Willschke and Schaden."

An understanding of the factors can provide evidence based guidance to those at the beginning of their research careers in designing their own trajectories and to library administrators who seek to create work conditions that contribute to librarian research productivity. The current study is the first to explore the factors from the perspective of the profession's most accomplished librarian-researchers. Methods-This exploratory and descriptive study recruited 78 academic librarians identified as highly productive researchers; 46 librarians participated in a survey about their professional training and research environments, research networks, and beliefs about the research process. Respondents supplied a recent CV which was coded to produce a research output score for the past 10 years. In addition to fixed-response questions, there were five open-ended questions about possible success factors. All data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and tests of significance correlations. Results-Accomplished librarian-researchers have professional training backgrounds and research environments that vary widely. None is statistically associated with research output. Those with densely connected networks of research colleagues who both know each other and do research together is significantly related to research output. A large group of those identified in the research networks are ""both friend and colleague"" and offer each other reciprocal support. In open-ended questions, respondents mentioned factors that equally span the three categories of research success: individual attributes, peers and community, and institutional structures. Conclusion-The authors found that that there are many paths to becoming an accomplished librarian-researcher and numerous factors are conducive to achieving this distinction. A positive research environment includes high institutional expectations; a variety of institutional supports for research; and extrinsic rewards, such as salary increases, tenure, promotion, and opportunities for advancement. The authors further conclude that a librarian's research network may be an important factor in becoming an accomplished librarian-researcher. This finding is supported by both the research network analysis and responses to open-ended questions in which collaboration was a frequent theme. © 2020 Kennedy, Brancolini, and Kennedy."

Among these gases, carbon dioxide is considered as the prominent gas which motivated researchers to explore carbon reduction and mitigation strategies. Research work on this domain expands from carbon emission reporting to identifying and implementing carbon mitigation and reduction strategies. A comprehensive study to map global research on carbon emissions is, however, not available. Therefore, based on a scientometric analysis method, this study reviewed the global literature on carbon emissions. A total of 2945 bibliographic records, from 1981 to 2019, were extracted from theWeb of Science core collection database and analyzed using techniques such as co-author and co-citation analysis. Findings revealed an increasing trend of publications in the carbon emission research domain, which has been more visible in the past few years, especially during 2016-2018. The most significant contribution to the domain was reported from China, the United States, and England. While most prolific authors and institutions of the domain were from China, authors and institutions from the United States reported the best connection links. It was revealed that evaluating greenhouse gas emissions and estimating the carbon footprint was popular among the researchers. Moreover, climate change and environmental effects of carbon emissions were also significant points of concern in carbon emission research. The key findings of this study will be beneficial for the policymakers, academics, and institutions to determine the future research directions as well as to identify with whom they can consult to assist in developing carbon emission control policies and future carbon reduction targets. © 2019 by the authors."

Cardiovascular quality and outcomes,11,12,,e005040,,,10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.005040,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in the representation of women in medical training, women continue to be underrepresented in cardiology, academic medicine, and more specifically, in senior positions within academic medicine. Identifying disparities in research productivity and acknowledgment can highlight barriers to female representation in academic cardiology leadership, as well as in academic promotion. METHODS AND RESULTS: This bibliometric analysis included all authors of original research articles between 1980 and 2017 from 3 high-impact cardiology journals ( Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Circulation, and European Heart Journal). We identified 71 345 unique authors of 55 085 primary research articles during our study period. Female authors accounted for 33.1% of all authors; however, they represented only 26.7% of first authors and 19.7% of senior authors. Looking at the most prolific authors within this time period, female authors were not well represented, accounting for only 5% of the top 100 authors. Articles with a female senior author had more female middle authors than articles with a male senior author (mean 1.41 versus 0.97, P<0.001) and were more likely to have a female first author (0.37 versus 0.18, P<0.001). There was an increased representation of female authors as first and senior authors compared with the total number of articles with female authors over time ( P<0.001 for trend); however, female senior authorship rates continued to lag first authorship rates. CONCLUSIONS: Using a large database of published manuscripts, we found that female representation in published cardiology research has increased over the past 4 decades. However, women continue to be not well represented as first authors, senior authors, and in the number of publications. When women were senior authors, they published more articles with female first authors and had more female authors. In addition to recruiting more women into the field of cardiology, additional work is needed to identify and address barriers to academic advancement for female physician-scientists."

In this paper, we discuss how the system was formalized as a multi-graph, and how similarity relations were identified through word2vec. We also provide three meaningful queries for exploring the DBLP community to (i) investigate author profiles by analysing their publication records; (ii) identify the most prolific authors on a given topic, and (iii) perform social network analyses over the whole community. To date, GraphDBLP contains 5+ million nodes and 24+ million relationships, enabling users to explore the DBLP data by referencing more than 3.3 million publications, 1.7 million authors, and more than 5 thousand publication venues. Through the use of word-embedding, more than 7.5 thousand keywords and related similarity values were collected. GraphDBLP was implemented on top of the Neo4j graph database.

With the help of 655 structured data retrieved from the Web of Science, we found a rapid growth trend of published productions. The most prolific authors, institutions and countries (territories) are mainly from Turkey and Taiwan, and this indicates this journal was dominated by these two countries (territories). Analysis of research themes showed science education, teacher education, mathematics education, attitude/attitudes research, problem solving and professional development were the main research themes for this journal. The citation impact analysis of research theme showed that three themes (i.e., student teacher, Technology Acceptance Model and animals) attracted more citations than others. Six clusters were identified which formed the main knowledge base of this journal. Analysis of cited and citing journals presented the knowledge commutation status of EJMSTE between other journals.

Quality is a journey which can only be judged through the scholarly communications produced, especially papers published in journals. However, assessing the quality of individual papers by peer review is not trouble-free and sometimes leads to disagreement too. Partly for these reasons, the quality of the journal that the paper is published in is widely taken into consideration for the quality of the paper itself. The present study explores the publication pattern of scholarly articles of the Journal ""Information Processing and Management, "" a leading international journal published by Elsevier and indexed under Science Direct Database. It examines and presents an analysis of 550 articles (under Top25 hottest article of Science Direct) cited within the period from 2008 to 2013. The scholarly articles are analyzed from several bibliometric parameters such as the chronological distribution, authorship pattern and degree of collaboration, most prolific authors, country and institution-wise distribution, subject-wise distribution of articles, most downloaded and cited, the length of articles. Lotka's law is also applied to examine authors' productivity pattern and productivity index. Results indicated that a high level of collaboration exists among the authors, Information Science taking shape of a developing discipline within LIS and USA occupies the dominant position in terms of productive authors, institutions and country.

The results show the most prolific authors, the evolution of scientific production, the educational stages considered, the types of studies, the designs and the educational implications of their application in the classrooms. In light of these, we can conclude that there are not many authors with an excellent production regarding this subject, because this research’s line is still incipient in Spain. The attention devoted to the different educational stages by research in Didactic of Experimental Sciences is not equitable, with the most affected being the stages of Infantile and Primary Education. There are more articles of a theoretical nature than empirical ones, given the lack of experimental studies that prove this teaching approach is patent. However, the educational implications derived from Spanish publications are similar to the international ones.

The analysis focuses on six key metrics of the journal’s publications: (a) the nature of authorship, (b) the most influential articles, (c) the most influential authors, (d) the most prolific authors, (e) the themes covered, and (f) the manuscript characteristics of the articles published during the period. Notes for contributors, book reviews, conference reports/proceedings, practice papers, and editorials were excluded from the scope of this research, and 292 research articles appearing in the journal during this time were included in the investigation. Data were analyzed using SPSS and Excel. The article provides an overview of the evolution of the journal and presents some key trends in ongoing research within the industry. The study finds a clear trend toward coauthorship with a substantial increase in triple-authored articles. The majority of the articles have gone from being single authored in 2000–2004 to being dual authored in 2010–2014. Articles on marketing and consumer behavior, HR management, and environmental aspects have experienced a steady increase while strategic implications, hospitality and tourism operations, impact assessment and mitigation, and education have received a decreased attention. There has been a significant drop in theory development articles, in favor of quantitative research designs, in particular survey studies. Qualitative research designs rest relatively constant; however, case studies and interviews have lost ground to content analysis manuscripts.

Formal validation of SAD was not considered prior to the early 1990s, when considerable effort began to be invested developing SAD and assessing their value for improving accuracy of estimates of disease severity in many pathosystems. Peer-reviewed literature post-1990 was identified, selected, and cataloged in bibliographic software for further scrutiny and extraction of scientometric, pathosystem-related, and methodological-related data. In total, 105 studies (127 SAD) were found and authored by 327 researchers from 10 countries, mainly from Brazil. The six most prolific authors published at least seven studies. The scientific impact of a SAD article, based on annual citations after publication year, was affected by disease significance, the journal’s impact factor, and methodological innovation. The reviewed SAD encompassed 48 crops and 103 unique diseases across a range of plant organs. Severity was quantified largely by image analysis software such as QUANT, APS-Assess, or a LI-COR leaf area meter. The most typical SAD comprised five to eight black-and-white drawings of leaf diagrams, with severity increasing nonlinearly. However, there was a trend toward using true-color photographs or stylized representations in a range of color combinations and more linear (equally spaced) increments of severity. A two-step SAD validation approach was used in 78 of 105 studies for which linear regression was the preferred method but a trend toward using Lin’s correlation concordance analysis and hypothesis tests to detect the effect of SAD on accuracy was apparent. Reliability measures, when obtained, mainly considered variation among rather than within raters. The implications of the findings and knowledge gaps are discussed. A list of best practices for designing and implementing SAD and a website called SADBank for hosting SAD research data are proposed. © 2017 The American Phytopathological Society."

However, the recent status of research on orthopedics among individuals in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan is unknown. In this study, we investigated characteristics and trends of orthopedics publications from these three regions. Methods: Between 2003 and 2014, all articles published in 63 orthopedics journals originating from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were identified via Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) database. A survey was conducted to systematically analyze the published orthopedics articles from the three regions according to the numbers of articles, study design, impact factors (IFs), citations, most prolific authors, and institutions. Additionally, we evaluated global trends in orthopedics publications, and ranked top 10 countries in terms of the total number of published articles over 12 years and the number of published articles per year. Results: A total number of 123,317 articles were published in the 63 orthopedics journals between 2003 and 2014. The worldwide number of annually published orthopedics articles tended to increase during the study period. The total number of orthopedics publications from the three regions, especially in mainland China, increased markedly from 2003 to 2014. The annual number of orthopedics articles from mainland China increased from 6 in 2003 to 813 in 2014, Hong Kong increased from 32 in 2003 to 71 in 2014, and Taiwan increased from 68 in 2003 to 168 in 2014. For accumulated IFs and total citations of articles, mainland China ranked the first place, followed by Taiwan and Hong Kong. However, publications from Taiwan had the highest average citations per article, and publications from Hong Kong had the highest average IFs. Among the top 10 most prolific authors and institutions, 4 authors and 4 institutions were from Taiwan, 3 authors and 4 institutions were from mainland China, and 3 authors and 2 institutions were from Hong Kong. Conclusions: The quantity of articles published in international orthopedics journals from mainland China presented a remarkable upward trend during the past 12 years. Given the relative size of the populations, it should be emphasized that mainland China still has a long way to go to achieve the academic performance of Hong Kong and Taiwan. © 2016 The Author(s)."

However, 'rural entrepreneurship' has been largely overlooked. It seems therefore timely to present a quantitative survey of the literature in this particular area. Based on 181 articles on rural entrepreneurship published in journals indexed in Scopus, we found that rural entrepreneurship is an essentially European concern, whose most prolific authors are affiliated with institutions in the UK and Spain. Organisational characteristics, policy measures and institutional frameworks and governance have attracted considerable attention in recent years, being considered emergent topics of research. In contrast, theory building has not attracted much research over the period in analysis, which suggests that the theoretical body of rural entrepreneurship is still incipient, hindering the establishment of its boundaries and of a suitable research agenda. Empirical literature on rural entrepreneurship has focused mainly on developed countries, most notably, the UK, the USA, Spain, Finland and Greece. Given the potential rural entrepreneurship represents for less developed and underdeveloped countries, more research on the topic targeting these countries is an imperative. © 2014 The Authors.

The geographical influences of the authors were subsequently visualized. Sediment-related research experienced notable growth in the past two decades. Multidisciplinary geosciences and environmental sciences were the two major categories, and Environmental Science and Technology was the most active journal. Damsté JSS and Schouten S were the two most prolific authors with the most high-quality articles and the greatest geographic influences. The major spatial clusters of authors overlapped quite well with regions with high economic growth in the USA, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia. The USA was the largest contributor in global sediment research with the most independent and collaborative papers, and the dominance of the USA was also confirmed in the national collaboration network. National academic output was positively associated with its economic capability. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the US Geological Survey and the Russian Academy of Sciences were the three major contributing institutions. A keywords analysis determined that ""evolution"", ""water"", ""soil(s)"", and ""model"" were consistent hotspots in sediment research. Several keywords such as ""organic-matter"", ""Holocene"", ""dynamics"", ""erosion"", ""sediment transport"", ""climate"", and ""heavy-metal"" received dramatically increased attention during the study period. Through co-word analysis, significant differences were observed between environmental and multidisciplinary geosciences in terms of the most frequently used keywords, and the prevalent research topic patterns were ascertained. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."

Our aim was to characterize the collaborative patterns of CEA conducted over the past two decades in Spain. Methods and Findings: A systematic analysis was carried out with the information obtained through an updated comprehensive literature review and from reports of health technology assessment agencies. We identified CEAs with outcomes expressed as a time-based summary measure of population health (e.g. quality-adjusted life-years or disability-adjusted life-years), conducted in Spain and published between 1989 and 2011. Networks of coauthorship and institutional collaboration were produced using PAJEK software. One-hundred and thirty-one papers were analyzed, in which 526 authors and 230 institutions participated. The overall signatures per paper index was 5.4. Six major groups (one with 14 members, three with 7 members and two with 6 members) were identified. The most prolific authors were generally affiliated with the private-for-profit sector (e.g. consulting firms and the pharmaceutical industry). The private-for-profit sector mantains profuse collaborative networks including public hospitals and academia. Collaboration within the public sector (e.g. healthcare administration and primary care) was weak and fragmented. Conclusions: This empirical analysis reflects critical practices among collaborative networks that contributed substantially to the production of CEA, raises challenges for redesigning future policies and provides a framework for similar analyses in other regions. © 2012 Catalá-López et al."

Past research has demonstrated the breadth and depth of biblometric tools by investigating a variety of research communities (White and Griffith 1981; Tsay 1989; McCain 1991; Borgman and Rice 1992; White and McCain 1998; Smiraglia 2006, 2009, Moore 2007; Jank 2010). Using the published literature produced in SI from 1997 through 2009, allowed visualization of domain-coherence in SI. Concepts that were utilized by which to measure domain coherence include the number of ideas espoused (Collins 1998, 42), scholarly productivity (Crane 1972), and the number of scholars participating (Price 1986; Collins 1998). In this lightning paper based on a recent dissertation (Hoeffner 2012) we will present a visualization based on the analysis of social informatics’ literature, showing growth in publication productivity, evidence of intellectually and socially connected scholars, reliance on scholars from within the fields of information science, and computer science, and two or three topical areas of interest that pertained to communication and aspects of computer mediation, as well as policy and access. Discourse among scholars was evident, and although the Journal of the American Society for Information Science & Technology overwhelming published the largest number of SI work, there was representation in a few key journals. Author co-citation patterns revealed a core group of scholars commonly cited together, and an investigation of self-citation practices revealed slightly less evidence among SI’s most prolific authors than in science overall. Recently, Smiraglia (2012) defined a domain as “a domain is a group with an ontological base that reveals an underlying teleology, a set of common hypotheses, epistemological consensus on methodological approaches, and social semantics.” Our visualization demonstrates continued coherence of SI as a domain. © 2014, American Society for Information Science and Technology.

Our objective was to characterize Spanish scientific output in Dentistry through the analysis of Web of Science database in a 20- year period. By means of a bibliometric study documents were statistically analyzed using indicators that showed quantitative and qualitative aspects of the production. Specifically, time course of the scientific production within the time span was analysed, as were the journals where the article was published and the categories of Journal Citation Reports (JCR) in which they belong, thematic areas, authorship, and finally authors and institutions with the highest production in Spain. Material and Methods: By means of the design of a specific search strategy previously described in the scientific literature, we recovered all citable documents about Dentistry signed by Spanish researchers and included in the WoS database between 1993 and 2012. Results: A total of 3006 documents fulfilled the search criteria, of which 2449 (81.5%) were published in journals within the category Dentistry Oral Surgery and Medicine and 557 (18.5%) within other categories of the JCR. During the four quinquenniums studied, the production increased quantitatively (8.6-fold) and qualitatively. Finally, the universities of Granada and Complutense of Madrid were the institutions with the highest production and most prolific authors.

However, there has not been an extensive scientometric evaluation of the institutional research carried out by the universities in the Marmara Region of Turkey, to examine the development of the research over time. Hence, the purpose of this study was to carry out a scientometric evaluation of the research performed by these universities using three indices in a series of four papers. In the third part of these serial papers, it was found that the placement of incorrect names for the university name in the affiliation section of the abstract pages of the papers was a serious problem especially for the institutions with more than two words in their names resulting in the lack of visibility in the institutional rankings. The preferred name format for the name of the institutions was ""x univ"" rather than ""univ x"". There were 57,860 articles and reviews published by these universities and 94.6% of these papers were indexed by the SCIE as they were related to Natural and Applied Sciences. Only 7.5% and 1.1% of these papers were indexed by SSCI and A&HCI, respectively as they were concerned with Social Sciences and Arts & Humanities. There were strong Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities deficits in the research output of Marmara Universities. These results were in line with the results relating to the research productivity of Turkish Universities at a national scale. The most prolific author was ""Sen Z"" of the Department of the Civil Engineering, Istanbul Technical University and the most prolific authors were from Istanbul Technical University (5), Koc University (1), Kadir Has University (1), Istanbul University (2), and Gebze Institute of Advanced Technology (1). The most prolific authors were from the Natural Sciences departments, the Engineering departments and Health Sciences departments. It is thus notable that there were not any most prolific authors from Social Sciences as well as Humanities & Arts. It was found that the top most prolific institution in terms of the number of publications was Istanbul University and the SSCI and A&HCI-related relative subject dominance was pronounced for the Yeditepe University, Marmara University, and Sakarya University. The top university in terms of the H-index was Istanbul University with H-index of more than 100, closely followed by the Bogazici University, Istanbul Technical University, Marmara University, and Koc University with H-index of 83, 78, 60, and 55, respectively. The results found in the third part suggest that there was a close structure-research performance relationships for these universities hinting the strong effect of the formal and informal rules adapted by these universities on their respective research productivity following North's new institutional theoretical framework. © Sila Science.

We view author identification as a single label classification problem, where 2000 authors would imply 2000 possible categories to assign to a post. Experiments with a naive Bayes classifier on a blog author identification task demonstrate a remarkable tendency to over-predict the most prolific authors. Literature search confirms that the class imbalance phenomenon is a challenge for author identification as well as other machine learning tasks. We develop a vector projection method to remove this hazard, and achieve a 63% improvement in accuracy over the baseline on the same task. Our method adds no additional asymptotic computational complexity to naive Bayes, and has no free parameters to set.

Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) presenting a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) ratio is frequently used to determine ""value for money"" in health care. Despite the proliferation of CEA research, there has been no detailed study focusing on the bibliometric properties of this literature. Objectives. To describe and analyze trends in publications and coauthorship in the CEA literature from 1976 to 2006 and to identify the most prolific authors and research groups conducting CEAs. Methods. The authors used the Tufts Medical Center Registry of original CEAs published through 2006 (www.cearegistry.org). For each article, they recorded the year of publication, the journal title, and the number of contributing authors and their names. Authors were assigned credit based on their weighted contribution to the study (1 credit point for the first and last authors, 1/2 point for the second author, and 1=n credit points for all other authors, where n reflects the number of coauthors). Results. Approximately 1400 CEAs presenting a cost/QALY ratio were published in 420 journals through 2006. The mean number of contributing authors was 4.7 ± 2.4. Medical journals were characterized by a higher number of coauthors, as compared with the economic and health policy journals: 4.8 ± 2.4 v. 4.2 ± 2.0, P < 0.001. The lowest average number of coauthors was in Medical Decision Making (3.6) and the highest in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (8.2). The most prolific authors were affiliated with Harvard and Tufts Universities and their affiliated hospitals. The authors identified 4 major research groups that contributed substantially to the field of cost-effectiveness analysis but did not find any substantial academic relationships across these groups. Conclusions. The CEA literature continues to proliferate. Coauthorship trends appear to follow the rapid increase in the mean number of authors found in other publication types."

Length of literary career predicted the output of both fiction and nonfiction work. Judged literary eminence and gender predicted variation in nonfiction output but not fiction output. However, a substantial proportion of the variance in output could not be explained by career length or the other variables included. Age trends in productivity were similar to those predicted by Simonton's (1984b) information processing model, but there were differences in the trends of the least and most prolific authors. Consideration of biographical information about individual authors revealed lengthy gaps in the literary careers of the least prolific novelists. The results suggest the need to include both intra-individual factors and social support factors in explaining variation in creative productivity."

This demonstration study suggests that the Internet, particularly one prominent website for patrons of commercial sex in Britain, can assist in learning more about the activities of prostitutes' clients, their patterns of behaviour and the organisation of commercial sex in contemporary society. The specific focus here is on the geographical locations of the paid sexual encounters of the ten most prolific authors who contribute to a popular website. It reveals 105 different locations identified in the reports with some punters travelling extensively for their pleasures. The study then focuses on a comparison of the activities of two of these punters showing how they both largely inhabit different worlds of the sex industry but also share some experiences. This paper contributes additional knowledge about prostitution at several levels: first, a microanalysis of a small sample of clients' purchasing patterns highlights the habits of some prolific patrons; second, alongside these patterns, the website offers a window onto the hidden world of prostitution in late modernity which in turn reveals some organisational features of prostitution; and third, the use of the Internet as a qualitative data source is explored. © Sociological Research Online, 1996-2005."

Knowledge diffusion within institutions is influenced by not just the status of individual researchers but also the collaborative culture that determines status. There are various methods to measure individual status, but few studies have compared them or explored the possible effects of different cultures on the status measures. In this article, we examine knowledge diffusion within science and technology-oriented research organizations. Using social network analysis metrics to measure individual status in large-scale coauthorship networks, we studied an individual's impact on the recombination of knowledge to produce innovation in nanotechnology. Data from the most productive and high-impact institutions in China (Chinese Academy of Sciences), Russia (Russian Academy of Sciences), and India (Indian Institutes of Technology) were used. We found that boundary-spanning individuals influenced knowledge diffusion in all countries.

Collaboration networks and their impact on scientific activities thus already attracted some attention in the research community, but no work so far studied possible factors which can influence the network positions of the researchers at the individual level. The objective of this paper is to investigate various characteristics and roles of the researchers occupying important positions in the collaboration network. For this purpose, we focus on the collaboration network among Canadian researchers during the period of 1996 to 2010 and employ multiple regression models to estimate the impact on network structure variables. Results highlight the crucial role of past productivity of the researchers along with their available funding in determining and improving their position in the co-authorship network. It is shown that researchers who have great influence on their local community do not necessarily publish high quality works. We also find that highly productive researchers not only have more important connections but also play a critical role in connecting other researchers. Moreover, although mid-career scientists tend to collaborate more in knit groups and on average have higher influence on their local community, our results specifically highlight the important role of young researchers who occupy mediatory positions in the network which enable them to connect different communities and fuel information transmission through the network. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach – The author used a geographically dispersed data set involving authors in the field of economics in ten countries in Southeast Asia and applied social network analysis methods to investigate the structure and dynamics of GCs. Findings – Results reveal that a GC, characterized by both low density and small size, can still capture a significant percentage (68 per cent of the top 25) of the most productive authors. There seems to be a topological backing for this occurrence. The number of direct connections (or “degree”) in the GC was correlated with research productivity, such that high-degree authors were almost twice as productive as low-degree authors. It is probable that productive authors having higher than average degrees may be the cause of the formation of the GC. The author hypothesize that irrespective of its size or sparseness, GCs in co-authorship networks may still represent the seat of main intellectual activity in the network. Originality/value – This is one of the first studies to quantitatively analyse the ability of a co-authorship-based less-prominent GC to capture prominent authors. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

A sample of 134 Australian university economists were classified as low, average and high in respect of their publication performance using cluster analysis. Discriminant analysis was then used to see whether membership of these groups was associated with items representing individuals' preferred research approach, their involvement in a range of research-related activities, the things which they felt constrained their research and their perceptions of the benefits of their position which might be conducive to research. Our results show that there was a relationship between these items and group membership, and therefore productivity. Highly productive researchers made deliberate choices about the type of research they undertook in order to enhance their career advancement; they were heavily involved in a number of areas of research activity; they felt relatively few constraints on their research by comparison with low producers; and they enjoyed the freedom and challenge of their positions. These results imply that research performance is more a function of individual motivation than resource support. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers."

This study aims to analyze the research productivity of the most prolific authors of Pakistan considering their trends toward publications, citations and collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: Top 100 authors from the top 10 Pakistani universities from Web of Science over the 10 years with the rigorous data cleaning process were selected. Scientometric analysis techniques were carried out to evaluate the research profile of these authors. Findings: The findings revealed that majority of the productive authors were male working in the position of Professor in the physical sciences area. The publications and citations gradually increase with time. They preferred to collaborate for their publications, while first authorship publications were found less in number. Moreover, the propensity to collaborate at the international level increases double-fold from the first five years to the next five years period. In addition, the position of the authors was explored among different performance metrics. The finding exhibits variation in the ranking of authors among them. The impact of numbers of authors, funding status, publication of articles, presence of collaboration and international collaboration on the dependent variable and citation count was insignificant. However, the publication of review papers has a significant impact on the citation counts. Practical implications: Findings have significant implications for policymakers to make maximum opportunities for researchers to strengthen linkages for collaboration and increase the funding prospects. Originality/value: Studies on this topic are scarce, and therefore, this study provides useful recommendations to researchers and institutes to improve research productivity. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Particularly, we are interested in investigating and characterizing a subset of such hyperprolific authors who present a sudden growth in the number of published articles and coauthors, as well as concentrate their publications in a few specific journals, what can be seen as an anomalous behavior. Using data collected from the DBLP repository and covering the last 10 years, we propose a set of discriminative dimensions (features) aimed at characterizing the behavior of hyperprolific authors, ultimately helping to identify anomalous ones. Moreover, using a strategy based on ranking aggregation to identify the most prominent anomalous authors, we demonstrate that the best dimensions to characterize such anomalous behaviors may vary significantly among authors, but it is possible to identify a clear subset of them who present such behavior. Our results show that the top-ranked (most anomalous) authors manifest a distinct behavior from the middle-ranked ones. Indeed, each one of the five most anomalous authors published more than 48 journal articles in 2021 while collaborating with more than 1,000 coauthors in their careers. Specifically, one of such authors published more than 140 articles in just a single journal. © 2023, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."

Major findings are that both quality and quantity parameters represent im-portant feature of MPRs. The best among top researchers have substantially better parameters than those at the bottom level of ranking. We also find that many MPRs publish excellent publications and receive high number of citations. The best-cited publications have researchers exhibiting low number of total pub-lications. Among factors contributing to success of MPRs are team, cooperation, specialization, Ph.D. supervising, international project participation, multiple-use products and some other factors. Finally, looking at the patterns character-izing 22 research fields reveals differences. The clinical medicine field, e.g., is the area of research with the largest number of published WoS documents and citations. Multidisciplinary sciences show significantly lower values.

Only a small minority of researchers is responsible for the majority of the knowledge production. However, little is known about the factors that might explain the prestige and the working habits of these researchers. In this paper, we therefore examine the coauthorship networks of the most productive European researchers over a 12-year time window, between the years 2007 and 2018. Explicitly, we look at the impact that these collaborative structures have upon the citations of the researchers. We show that highly productive researchers gain benefits in terms of citations by increasing their research output, by embedding themselves in large geographically dispersed coauthorship networks, as well as by publishing with highly cited collaborators. These results substantiate a prestige effect (the best tend to collaborate with the best) that governs the behaviour of the most productive researchers.

All authors in the science network receive the majority of their credit from high-impact authors; however, this effect decreases as authors' impact levels decrease. Similarly, the proportion of citations that lower-impact authors make to each other increases as authors' impact levels decrease. High-impact authors, who have the highest degree of membership in the science network, publish fewer papers in comparison to highly productive authors. However, authors with the highest impact make both more references per paper and also more citations to papers in the science network.

The rank approach was applied in the preparation of the study model resulting in the selection of a set of the most prolific authors. In the course of that process, multiple authorship problem was solved by a dual approach, consisting of ""normal count"" and ""modified straight count"" procedures. As shown by the analysis of collaborative patterns, either on individual or on group scales, scientific output is highly dependent on the frequency of collaboration among the same authors. Expressed as ""the collaboration measure"", it might serve as an indicator in comparative analyses of scientific productivity in a given field of science. © 1986 Akadémiai Kiadó."

Among them, we explored the usefulness of the Percentage of Papers by the Most Prolific author (PPMP) and the Gini index (level of inequality in the distribution of authorship among authors) as tools to identify journals that may show favoritism in accepting articles by specific authors. We examined whether the PPMP, complemented by the Gini index, could be useful for identifying cases of potential editorial bias, using all articles in a sample of 5,468 biomedical journals indexed in the National Library of Medicine. For articles published between 2015 and 2019, the median PPMP was 2.9%, and 5% of journal exhibited a PPMP of 10.6% or more. Among the journals with the highest PPMP or Gini index values, where a few authors were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications, a random sample was manually examined, revealing that the most prolific author was part of the editorial board in 60 cases (61%). The papers by the most prolific authors were more likely to be accepted for publication within 3 weeks of their submission. Results of analysis on a subset of articles, excluding nonresearch articles, were consistent with those of the principal analysis. In most journals, publications are distributed across a large number of authors. Our results reveal a subset of journals where a few authors, often members of the editorial board, were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications. To enhance trust in their practices, journals need to be transparent about their editorial and peer review practices. Copyright: © 2021 Scanff et al.

The creation of an impact beam plot (IBP) as a research profile for individuals is crucial, especially when incorporating collection edges that include self-cited articles through a rare cluster analysis technique not commonly found in the literature. This study presents the application of a unique method called the following-leading clustering algorithm (FLCA) to generate IBPs for 3 highly productive authors. Methods: For the 3 highly productive authors, Sung-Ho Jang from South Korea, Chia-Hung Kao from Taiwan, and Chin-Hsiao Tseng from Taiwan, all their published articles indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection were downloaded. Sung-Ho Jang published 593 articles, Chia-Hung Kao published 732 articles, and Chin-Hsiao Tseng published 160 articles. To analyze and showcase their publications, the FLCA was utilized. This algorithm helped cluster their articles and identify representative publications for each author. To assess the effectiveness and validity of the FLCA algorithm, both network charts and heatmaps with dendrograms were employed. IBPs were then created and compared for each of the 3 authors, taking into consideration their h-index, x-index, and self-citation rate. This allowed for a comprehensive visual representation of their research impact and citation patterns. Results: The results show that these authors' h-index, x-index, and self-citation rates were (37, 44.01, 1.66%), (42, 61.47, 0.23%), and (37, 40.3, 6.62%), respectively. A higher value in these metrics indicates a more remarkable research achievement. A higher self-citation rate with a lower cluster number indicates that manuscripts are more likely to have been self-drafted. Using the FLCA algorithm, IBPs were successfully generated for each author. Conclusion: The FLCA algorithm allows for the easy generation of visual IBPs based on authors' publication profiles. These IBPs incorporate 3 important bibliometric metrics: h-index, x-index, and self-citations. These metrics are highly recommended for use by researchers globally, particularly with the self-citation rate, as they offer valuable insights into the scholarly impact and citation patterns of individual researchers. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

CPD is crucial as it upgrades employees' skills and has the potential to increase productivity and improve customer service in libraries. Therefore, there is need for extensive research in this area. Web of Science (WoS) core collection database was used to retrieve sample data for the bibliometric analysis. A total of 165 records were retrieved. After abstract screening, 77 records specific to CPD of librarians were analysed. A statistical software package called R (Biblioshiny) and VOSviewer were used for data visualization. This study was limited to publications written in English and indexed on WoS only. The study findings revealed that most productive countries in this research area are the USA, the United Kingdom and Australia. In Africa, Nigeria and South Africa have taken the lead. In terms of most productive institutions, University of Nigeria and the University of Sheffield ranked first. Considering the publication period, 2009 and 2013 were the most productive. Library Trends and Journal of Librarianship & Information Science are the most productive publishers. Research on CPD of librarians is dominant in academic libraries, hence there is need for similar studies to be conducted in public and school libraries. Most prolific authors are E. Hornung G. Hallam and S. Lewis. However, F. M. Mason and M. R. Kennedy have the highest number of citations. The citation impact shows that research activity pertaining to CPD of librarians is very low. Low research productivity in CPD of librarians may inhibit informed decision making due to lack of availability of scientific research output. As a result, libraries may continue to have an unskilled and irrelevant workforce that does not meet the changing demands of the 21st century users. Especially African countries and other developing nations. Therefore, this paper has attempted to raise awareness on the research dynamics pertaining to CPD of librarians through bibliometric analysis. It is hoped that this work will trigger more research interest in LIS discipline. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."

This study aims to analyse the phenomenon of self-publishing from the point of view of the research being done on it. Thus, in addition to studying the subject, it is going to be possible to analyse the viability of this methodology as an analysis technique. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is based on a combination of traditional bibliometric studies and analysis of social networks applied. Findings - Self-publishing is a phenomenon that is being studied by the scientific community. But the research on this topic has a low rate of co-authorship and a low relationship between the most prolific authors and their relevance. The combination of techniques used has proven to be a very good choice for analyzing the data. Originality/value - There are not enough works analyzing the research in self-publishing. Because of the peculiarities of the topic, a combination of various techniques will provide a better approach to its study, so, this paper contains some results using bibliometrics and others using social network analysis applied. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Obviously, it is different among fields of science, social science, and humanities because of systematic differences in publication and citation behaviour across disciplines. In the past, the citation potential was studied at journal level considering the average number of references in established groups of journals (for example, the crown indicator is based on the journal subject categories in the Web of Science database). In this paper, some characterizations of the author’s scientific research through three different research dimensions are proposed: production (journal papers), impact (journal citations), and reference (bibliographical sources). Then, we propose different measures of the citation potential for authors based on a proportion of these dimensions. An empirical application, in a set of 120 randomly selected highly productive authors from the CSIC Research Centre (Spain) in four subject areas, shows that the ratio between production and impact dimensions is a normalized measure of the citation potential at the level of individual authors. Moreover, this ratio reduces the between-group variance in relation to the within-group variance in a higher proportion than the rest of the indicators analysed. Furthermore, it is consistent with the type of journal impact indicator used. A possible application of this result is in the selection and promotion process within interdisciplinary institutions, since it allows comparisons of authors based on their particular scientific research. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."

No studies have addressed research collaboration in network meta-analysis (NMA). In this study, we used social network analysis methods to characterize global collaboration patterns of published NMAs over the past decades. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched (at 9th July, 2015) to include systematic reviews incorporating NMA. Two reviewers independently selected studies and cross-checked the standardized data. Data was analyzed using Ucinet 6.0 and SPSS 17.0. NetDraw software was used to draw social networks. Results: 771 NMAs published in 336 journals from 3459 authors and 1258 institutions in 49 countries through the period 1997-2015 were included. More than three-quarters (n = 625; 81.06%) of the NMAs were published in the last 5-years. The BMJ (4.93%), Current Medical Research and Opinion (4.67%) and PLOS One (4.02%) were the journals that published the greatest number of NMAs. The UK and the USA (followed by Canada, China, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany) headed the absolute global productivity ranking in number of NMAs. The top 20 authors and institutions with the highest publication rates were identified. Overall, 43 clusters of authors (four major groups: one with 37 members, one with 12 members, one with 11 members and one with 10 members) and 21 clusters of institutions (two major groups: one with 62 members and one with 20 members) were identified. The most prolific authors were affiliated with academic institutions and private consulting firms. 181 consulting firms and pharmaceutical industries (14.39% of institutions) were involved in 199 NMAs (25.81% of total publications). Although there were increases in international and inter-institution collaborations, the research collaboration by authors, institutions and countries were still weak and most collaboration groups were small sizes. Conclusion: Scientific production on NMA is increasing worldwide with research leadership of Western countries (most notably, the UK, the USA and Canada). More authors, institutions and nations are becoming involved in research collaborations, but frequently with limited international collaborations. © 2016 Li et al.

The study uses a micro-analysis of informetrics researchers from 5,417 informetrics papers published in 7 core informetrics journals during 1948–2012. The most productive informetrics researchers were analysed in terms of productivity, citation impact, and co-authorship. The 30 most productive informetrics researchers of all time span several generations and seem to be usually the primary authors of their research, highly collaborative, affiliated with one institution at a time, and often affiliated with a few core European centres. Their research usually has a high total citation impact but not the highest citation impact per paper. Perhaps surprisingly, the US does not seem to be good at producing highly productive researchers but is successful at producing high impact researchers. Although there are exceptions to all of the patterns found, researchers wishing to have the best chance of being part of the next generation of highly productive informetricians may wish to emulate some of these characteristics. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."

Methods: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI) was used to identify the 30 most-published authors in 'cataract' and 'laser in situ keratomileusis' (LASIK) (2000-2004 inclusive). SCI was subsequently used to analyse the recorded articles for each author in terms of source journal, the most commonly cited articles and citation source. Results: Of the 30 most-published authors in the fields of cataract and LASIK, the USA was the most well-represented source country, accounting for 33%; 20% were from Australia, and 17% from Austria. Germany and Japan each contributed 7%. Eighty per cent of the publications produced by these 30 authors (2000-2004) were in 10 journals, of which the Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (JCRS) published more than one-third. Of the three most-cited articles for each author, the greatest number were published in JCRS (35.6%). The citation count of the articles had a weak correlation to the journal impact factor of the source journal; however, the self-citation rate of these articles did not. Conclusions: The USA and Australia together were the source of more than half of the most-published authors on cataract and LASIK and the majority of articles published by the 30 most prolific authors were published in only 10 journals. The impact factors of the publication journals preferred by these authors are influenced by the article citation counts, not vice versa. © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists."

It is therefore still establishing its professional knowledge base. This article uses peer-review author productivity distribution to evaluate its scholarly maturity. Methods: Four peer-reviewed journals in medical radiation sciences were examined over an 8-year period (2004-2011) and author productivity was compared to Lotka's law. Further analysis of the most prolific authors provided an evaluation of their characteristics. Results: The 1306 unique authors contributed 835 articles during the study period. Of these, 1012 (77.5%) contributed only one article to the journals studied, with an inverse power relationship of author productivity. At the 0.1 level of significance, radiography does not fit Lotka's law (n = -2.334; c = 0.712; Dmax = 0.0627; Critical threshold = 0.0337). There was a significant correlation between the most prolific authors and collaboration (P = 0.002), although variation was noted in author discipline and location.

However, this was only made possible by decades of investment in scientific research. Many important research commentaries and reviews have been provided to describe the various contributions and scientific breakthroughs that led to the development of COVID-19 vaccines. In this work, we sought to complement those efforts by adding a systematic and quantitative study of the research foundations that led to these vaccines. Here, we analyzed citations from COVID-19 vaccine research articles to determine which scientific areas of study contributed the most to this research. Our findings revealed that coronavirus research was cited most often, and by a large margin. However, significant contributions were also seen from a diverse set of fields such as cancer, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. In addition, we examined the publication history of the most prolific authors of COVID-19 vaccine research to determine their research expertise prior to the pandemic. Interestingly, although COVID-19 vaccine research relied most heavily on previous coronavirus work, we find that the most prolific authors on these publications most often had expertise in other areas including influenza, cancer, and HIV/AIDS. Finally, we used machine learning to identify and group together publications based on their major topic areas. This allowed us to elucidate the differences in citations between research areas. These findings highlight and quantify the relevance of prior research from a variety of scientific fields to the rapid development of a COVID-19 vaccine. This study also illustrates the importance of funding and sustaining a diverse research enterprise to facilitate a rapid response to future pandemics.

Design/methodology/approach: A range of bibliometric techniques have been used to analyse the performance of JMLC from Volume 14 (Issue 1) to Volume 24 (Issue 4). The Scopus database has been used to analyse the documents of JMLC. A total of 294 documents are reviewed. The bibliographic data has been analysed using the software VOS viewer and R-studio (Biblioshine) to assess the trend of publications, word growth, keyword co-occurrence, citation analysis, most prolific authors and authors’ impact. Findings: JMLC’s academic contributions, influence and impact have grown progressively. The thematic structure of the journal has evolved into six bibliographic clusters, noted as prevention of corruption due to money laundering; compliance and regulation of money laundering; customer due diligence; role of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the financial system of developing countries; control of terrorism and terrorist financing; and role of money laundering in the proceeds of crime. Research limitations/implications: The constraint of this endeavour largely arises from its selection of bibliographic data being confined to Scopus. Practical implications: The results of the study would help the current and future authors to understand the emerging themes in the field of money laundering and control. They are also going to help the editors of the journals of this domain to understand the emerging themes and how the published documents are going to contribute the society, throwing light on the controlling and compliance part of money laundering. Future research directions are provided in tackling the problem of money laundering, corruption, terrorism, crime, etc. with the help of financial intelligence, strong FATF all around the world, machine learning, Bitcoin exchange management and global knowledge management. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first objective assessment of the journal. Thus, the results of the study are useful to past and prospective authors, editorial board members, editors, readers and reviewers to gain a one-stop understanding of anti-money laundering actions through the contributions of JMLC. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

It explains the dynamics between economic growth and environmental degradation. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis for the past three decades (1994–2021) that contributes to the intellectual structure and knowledge progress of the EKC hypothesis using descriptive analysis and networking analysis. The descriptive analysis comprises publication trends, language, publishers, Web of Science category and research areas, and citation analysis. Meanwhile, networking analysis includes keyword co-occurrence analysis, co-authorship analysis and co-citation analysis. The findings of the descriptive analysis reveal that the number of publications in the EKC hypothesis has gradually increased over the years. The most productive publishers are Elsevier and Springer Nature. Researchers from China and Turkey tend to be the most prolific authors, with the highest number of citations, co-authorships and co-citations. According to the network analysis, the main keywords appearing in the EKC studies are economic growth, CO2 emissions, energy consumption, China, renewable energy and financial development, which is also supported by the most frequently used keyword plus and its clusters. Based on our findings, we have proposed several policy recommendations from the keyword analysis that could foster economic development and improve environmental quality simultaneously. From the emerging trends of EKC, new directions for future research are also proposed. © The Author(s) 2023."

It is necessary to have a general summary of schistosomiasis research after the new roadmap 2021–2030 issued by WHO. This study analyzes the current status of schistosomiasis research from the perspective of the One Health concept by analyzing important research literature published from 2011 to 2020, while further highlighting research priorities, difficulties, and research directions in order to propose suggestions for tropical disease studies research. Methods: Published literature related to schistosomiasis was searched from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. Focusing on a visual analysis of the main research literature in the field of schistosomiasis, CiteSpace software was used to conduct co-occurrence analysis with keywords, countries, institutions, and authors. Moreover, clustering and burst analyses of keywords and co-citation analysis of authors, publications, and journals were performed. Results: A total of 6638 schistosomiasis-related articles were published from 2011 to 2020, all of which can be sourced from the WoSCC database. The publication of schistosomiasis research has remained stable over the past 10 years, and contains studies in the area of human epidemiology, animal surveillance and the environment. The top five high-frequency keywords included Schistosoma mansoni, schistosomiasis, infection, praziquantel, and Schistosoma japonicum. The keywords formed nine clusters, including praziquantel, epidemiology, Schistosoma japonicum, helminths, protein, diagnosis, schistosomiasis, response, and haematobium. In recent years, most research studies focused on the mechanism of liver fibrosis, eliminating schistosomiasis, controlling risk factors, and the relationship between schistosomiasis infection and host immunity. The most productive countries include the United States, China, and Brazil, and the most productive institutions are the University of Basel, the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, and the University of São Paulo. Highly productive authors include Jürg Utzinger and Donald P. McManus.

Methods The literature related to talent training in health management was retrieved from the databases of CNKI, Wanfang Data, and VIP Journals from 2007 to 2022. The keywords used for retrieval included “health management”“curriculum system”“health manager”“evaluation system”“health service and management”and“talent training”. The time distribution of the literature was analyzed using Excel. Bibliometric analysis was conducted to visually analyze the research in health management talent training, focusing on authorship and collaboration, research institutions, high‑frequency keywords, and research hotspots. A knowledge map was created to outline the research framework. Results A total of 378 journal articles were retrieved. Over the past decade, there has been an overall increasing trend in the number of research publications related to health management talent training. The highest number of articles was published in 2021 (63 articles). In terms of spatial distribution, highly productive authors were relatively concentrated, and research institutions were mostly universities, with Hangzhou Normal University having the highest number of publications (14 articles). The research hotspots included health managers, practice teaching modes, cross‑cultivation, and discipline construction. The research frontiers concentrated on talent training modes, health service and management professions, talent demand, and curriculum system construction. Conclusions In the past decade, health management talents training in China has received more attention and importance. However, there is limited exchange and cooperation among authors and research institutions, and the research hotspots continue to extend in the direction of specialization and diversification. The transformation from vocational education to academic education and strengthening professional construction are the frontiers of the research. © 2023 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

During the past decades, a variety of models and methods have been developed to improve the performance of FPNs. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the literature on the FPN topic. The objective of this paper is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the FPN studies to generate a global picture of developments, focus areas, and research trends in this field. To achieve this goal, 272 journal articles extracted from the Web of Science over the period of 2000 to 2022 were analyzed with respect to cooperation network, co-citation network, and keyword co-occurrence network. The findings indicate that annual publication on the FPNs has increased rapidly since 2018. The cooperation network analysis shows that the most prolific authors in the area are Hu-Chen Liu from Tongji University and Victor R. L. Shen from National Taipei University. Via the co-citation network analysis, the influential authors are identified as Shyi-Ming Chen, Carl G. Looney, Tadao Murata, and the emerging research trends are obtained as “fault diagnosis”, “failure mode and effect analysis”, and “knowledge representation”. The keyword network analysis shows that the hot research topics in the FPN area are “expert system”, “knowledge representation”, “fault diagnosis” and “fuzzy reasoning”. Finally, according to the current research trends, possible future research directions concerning FPNs are revealed.

To date, there has been no study investigating evolution of this area in this region. The aim of this study was to evaluate for first time, the historical evolution of cancer genomics research in Latin America. Methods: Bibliometric cross-sectional study of documents on cancer genomics published by Latin American authors until 2023 in Scopus was performed. Statistical and visual analysis was performed with R programming language. Results: A total of 1534 documents were obtained. The first document of cancer genomics research was published in 1997, marking the inception of a 26-year evaluation period that extended until 2023. Among the documents, 74.3% (n = 1140) constituted original articles, followed by 22.7% (n = 349) classified as reviews. International collaboration was observed in 6.5% (n = 100) of the articles. Within the compilation of the ten most prolific authors in this region, 90% of them are from Brazil. This observed pattern extends to affiliations as well, wherein the Universidade de São Paulo emerges as the most active institution (n = 255 documents). This arrangement firmly establishes Brazil’s prominence as the preeminent country in the region concerning cancer genomics research, showcasing robust collaboration networks both regionally and intercontinentally. An important transition in the studied hot topics over the last 20 years was identified, from the exploration of the human genome and the characterization of genomic and proteomic cancer profiles (1997–2010) to an in-depth investigation of cancer stem cells and personalized medicine (2011–2023). Among the array of cancer types under study, predominant attention has been directed towards breast, lung, prostate, and leukemia. Conclusion: Over the course of the past 26 years, a favorable and notable evolution has characterized cancer genomics research within Latin America, with Brazil leading the way, which possess a robust network of regional and intercontinental collaboration. Furthermore, the lines of research and hot topics have change in harmony with the region’s objectives, strategies, and requisites.

The results show that aquaponics research has been growing significantly over the years. In recent years, aquaponics research primarily focused on the optimization of system performance (component ratio, hydraulic loading rate, hydroponic component, etc.), wastewater treatment, nutrient management, system production, technology adoption, and varieties of plants and fishes. The study identified the most prolific authors, journals, and affiliations in the field of aquaponics. The USA, Europe, and some Asian countries, especially China and India, are the most innovative regions with significant research in this area. Altmetric analysis found that aquaponics research has not received impressive online social attention and needs further social media promotion. However, publications have a considerable readership on Mendeley. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Due to different value activities in multiple countries and industry clusters, the competition and cooperation among value chains have attracted the considerable attention of business leaders and academicians worldwide. GVC-related sustainability research is a niche area despite its widespread presence in the literature. To bridge the gap, we use scientometric analysis in this paper, examining the corpus of 753 articles published in Web of Science journals from 2001 till 2021. This review illuminates the research performance constituents (e.g., most prolific authors, nations, institutions, and journals), the themes and issues that underpin the fields’ intellectual structure, and transforming discoveries. GVC depends on nine basic clusters for sustainability research (i.e., global value chain participation, gendered global production network, repositioning organisational dynamics, labour stands, learning opportunities, Internet era). Future studies can be conducted to generate new knowledge across ten thematic (based on keywords) clusters (i.e., market liberalisation, trade pollution nexus, value chain dynamics, global value chain reconfiguration, non-governmental organisation, multipolar governance). A model that encompasses current knowledge of the global value chain for sustainability is developed, and avenues for future research are provided. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Over time, the RU/WHFG research landscape has gained significant traction and yielded innovative technologies, sustainable strategies, and publications. However, critical studies highlighting current advancements, publication trends, research hotspots, major stakeholders, and future research directions on RU/WHFG research remain lacking. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis and literature review of the RU/WHFG research landscape based on publications indexed in Scopus. Results showed that 123 publications and 2191 citations were recovered between 2010 and 2022. Publication trends revealed that the growing interest in RU/WHFG is mainly due to environmental concerns (e.g. pollution, global warming, and climate change), research collaborations, and funding availability. Stakeholder analysis revealed that numerous researchers, affiliations, and countries have actively contributed to the growth and development of RU/WHFG. Lin Fu and Tsinghua University (China) are the most prolific researchers and affiliations, whereas the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and China are the most prolific funder and country, respectively. Funding availability from influential schemes such as NSFC has accounted for China’s dominance. Keyword co-occurrence identified three major research hotspots, namely, thermal energy utilisation and management (cluster 1), integrated energy and resource recovery (cluster 2), and system analysis and optimisation (cluster 3). Literature review revealed that researchers are currently focused on maximising thermodynamic/energy efficiency, fuel minimisation, and emission reduction.

It explicitly focuses on non-economic aspects conducive to AI-I, namely social, technological, cultural, sustainable, personal, moral, and ethical. Our analysis reveals that 1225 articles and proceeding papers have been published, and terms such as “technology,” “big data,” “management,” “performance,” “future,” and “impact” are the most frequently used when discussing innovation and AI. According to our time-zone analysis, the last two years have shown a significant emphasis on concepts such as “transformation,” “corporate social responsibility,” and “resource-based view.” In terms of citations, the countries that receive the highest number of references in the AI-I field are the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Australia, and China. The most prolific authors in terms of publications are David Teece, Erik Brynjolfsson, and Anjan Chatterjee. Given that most studies highlight the economic side of AI-I, we selected the most prolific 163 articles from all social science research areas. These studies legitimize the main non-economic aspects that highlight both certainties and uncertainties conducive to such innovations. Although the technological component is the most popular in our analysis of the non-economic aspects of the AI-I subfield, we find an important emphasis on ethical/moral dimensions conducive to slow innovation principles. We also observe a growing interest in the cultural dimension, specifically exploring potential factors that can lead to better human acceptance of these innovations. © 2024"

Nevertheless, several performance and vulnerability issues have been identified for the different typologies supporting the wide range of blockchain-based applications currently implemented in different domains. A variety of analytical and empirical models are being used to evaluate the issues associated with the different blockchain typologies, enabling systematic analyses of the corresponding efficiency impact, and technical or economic threats. A thorough systematic literature review of these models has been performed, followed by a detailed assessment on the way these models have been employed, and the target parameters and applications evaluated (336 research selected and analysed). We propose a co-classification of these models, allowing us to identify which ones are employed to a greater extent to address the different blockchain issues in scientific research. In a second step, a bibliometric analysis on the selected research is conducted, offering a complementary overview of the status of and trends in blockchain modelling, including the most prolific authors and leading contributing countries to the topic. The main outcome and contribution of the paper is the provision of a broad overview on how blockchain issues have been analytically tackled, through the synthesis and meta-analysis of the models used in the scientific literature since the inception of blockchain technology. The results have two main direct applications, firstly supporting novel vulnerability and performance analyses of existing blockchain applications by providing historical information on the models used so far, as well as the key parameters and typology of the blockchain-based applications evaluated. Secondly, in the implementation of new applications, by allowing the recognition of key issues identified that are associated with the different blockchain typologies and to determine the most suitable models to analyse the weaknesses and risks of the alternative designs under evaluation for these new implementations. © 2023 The Authors"

The development of emerging biotechnologies is uncovering the relationship between TBI and gut flora, and gut flora as a potential intervention target is of increasing interest to researchers. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research employing bibliometric methodologies to scrutinize the interrelation between these two. Therefore, this study visualized the relationship between TBI and gut flora based on bibliometric methods to reveal research trends and hotspots in the field. The ultimate objective is to catalyze progress in the preclinical and clinical evolution of strategies for treating and managing TBI. Methods: Terms related to TBI and gut microbiota were combined to search the Scopus database for relevant documents from inception to February 2023. Visual analysis was performed using CiteSpace and VOSviewer. Results: From September 1972 to February 2023, 2,957 documents published from 98 countries or regions were analyzed. The number of published studies on the relationship between TBI and gut flora has risen exponentially, with the United States, China, and the United Kingdom being representative of countries publishing in related fields. Research has formed strong collaborations around highly productive authors, but there is a relative lack of international cooperation. Research in this area is mainly published in high-impact journals in the field of neurology. The “intestinal microbiota and its metabolites,” “interventions,” “mechanism of action” and “other diseases associated with traumatic brain injury” are the most promising and valuable research sites. Targeting the gut flora to elucidate the mechanisms for the development of the course of TBI and to develop precisely targeted interventions and clinical management of TBI comorbidities are of great significant research direction and of interest to researchers. Conclusion: The findings suggest that close attention should be paid to the relationship between gut microbiota and TBI, especially the interaction, potential mechanisms, development of emerging interventions, and treatment of TBI comorbidities. Further investigation is needed to understand the causal relationship between gut flora and TBI and its specific mechanisms, especially the “brain-gut microbial axis.” Copyright © 2023 Du, Li, Liao, Li, Ye, Zhang, Gong, Yang and Li."

However, no systematic attempts to characterize the specific research trends and the scientific community focused on Patagonian cryosphere have been conducted so far. To fill this gap, we analyzed the metadata associated to 305 articles compiled from the Web of Science database following a bibliometric approach covering the period between 1976 and 2020. Our results point to an irregular but net increase on the number of contributions on Patagonian (paleo)glaciers. Mass balance analyses based on satellite data of present-day glaciers and the reconstruction of past glacier activity by dating glacial landforms formed during the Last Glacial Termination, were the most addressed topics during the analyzed period. Patagonian (paleo)glacier studies are mostly published in generic Earth Sciences publications, followed by Quaternary and glaciological journals. Most of the studies were led by scientists from the United Kingdom, followed by Chile, Argentina and United States. In terms of collaborations, these studies can be divided into two main clusters, one composed by researchers from United States, Chile and Argentina institutions, and another mostly composed by British researchers. So far, the most prolific authors are nearly equally distributed in nationality, yet gender inclusion and international collaborations are still caveats that must be solved. Even though our query on the Web of Science missed highly influential (so-called) grey literature, such as local scientific journals and technical reports, the reviewed scientific literature unambiguously indicates that Patagonia is a privileged location for (paleo)glaciers studies worldwide and that it will continue offering vast opportunities to tackle critical questions related to global cryosphere and past-to-present climate changes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

The review was conducted based on global trends, top journals, most prolific authors, most active e-waste research countries, and institutions centring on consumer participation in e-waste disposal and recycling behaviour. The present research has also identified around eleven factors that seem to have a bearing on consumer behaviour towards storage, disposal and recycling of e-waste. Findings: E-waste research has gained increased attention in the last five years. The majority of the studies has focused on motivational factors and ignore the risks associated with handling e-waste. The present study reports the pertinent issue of lack of awareness among the masses about e-waste handling and disposal. Thus, bringing to the fore the lack of awareness programmes and initiatives. The analysis presents the gaps in the literature and future research agendas. Originality/value: The review article will help in providing an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviour towards storage, disposal and recycling of e-waste and delineates the future direction of research that may be undertaken in this field of study. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The present study honors that milestone by conducting a retrospective examination of the research conducted in the journal over time and reflects on its rich history to look forward in the R&D management field. Using bibliometric techniques, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the journal's most prominent topics and themes, as well as its most prolific authors, institutions, and countries. The findings indicate that R&D Management has increased its productivity and reputation as measured by the number of published articles and citations per year and expanded its international reach from the initial European-dominated author base. We complement this analysis by performing an in-depth systematic literature review of the most frequently cited papers – annually and of all time – to disentangle the themes and concepts that prominently shaped the progress of the discipline itself. The results suggest that R&D Management has progressively widened its field of investigation from an intra-organizational perspective (1970–1992) to an inter-organizational view (1992–2006) and then to an extra-organizational outlook (2006–2018). Finally, based on this history and viewing the contributions from 2019 onwards, we identify an emerging set of research trajectories that we expect will pave the way for the future impact of R&D Management and the field at large. © 2023 The Authors.

This work shows that the number of publications on carbon finance-related research has increased rapidly; the Journal of Cleaner Production is the most productive journal. China boasts the most significant number of publications, while the United States has the most intensive cooperation with other countries. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is the most productive and influential independent institution, and Chinese authors make up the highest proportion of the top 20 most prolific authors. We can summarize the main research directions in carbon finance through keyword analysis: carbon capture, economic growth, carbon sequestration, financial development, modeling, and carbon price forecasting. Research related to the impact of energy consumption, renewable energy, and urbanization on carbon emissions may become a hot spot for future research in carbon finance. Through an in-depth analysis of the development over the past 30 years and future trends of carbon finance, this paper can provide some reference for future research, which is of great significance in promoting carbon emission reduction. © 2023 by the authors."

This bibliometric review explored the nature of research that had referred to robots in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders and psychology, outlining the range of research areas, most prolific researchers, outlets for research dissemination, and trends. Method: Using the database Scopus, publications were identified that mentioned in the abstract robot as well as one of several common neurodevelopmental disorders. Results were analyzed and visually presented using the software VOSviewer. An additional search identified publications about robots in the context of psychological research more broadly. Results: Studies about autism spectrum disorder and social communication skills were the most frequent. Much of this work is disseminated as publications related to engineering and neuroscience, which is also consistent with the background of the most prolific and cited researchers of this bibliometric search. A notable trend is the increasing role played by psychology in robotics research. Conclusions: Research work on robots in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders and psychology has traditionally been developed by researchers with a background primarily in engineering and computer science. As psychology is getting ready to play a more prominent role, there is a chance to apply specific psychological theory and methods. Such application may be facilitated by the establishment of a relevant scientific infrastructure, such as through a specialist journal on robopsychology. © 2023, The Author(s)."

However, despite this, there is a dearth of analysis into the state of research on African HE. This paper seeks to fill this gap by mapping and analysing African HE research. We undertake a systematic review of 6483 articles and books focusing on African HE published from 1980 to 2019 in indexed and non-indexed journals and book-publishers. We particularly examine the evolution of publications, the journals and book publishers, the authors’ affiliations, the researched countries, the publications’ thematic classification, the most prolific authors, and the most influential publications. Based on this analysis, we draw four main conclusions. First, research on African HE is a rather recent phenomenon or has witnessed a recent rise or renewal. Second, a few selected journals and book-publishers, particularly those with a strong regional or international reputation, dominate the field. Third, four communities of researchers are more represented: the community researching teaching and learning issues, the community focusing on structural transformation of HE, the community focusing on the internal organisation of HE and the community focusing on societal engagement of HE. Four, South Africa dominates the field both as home to most of the authors (including the most prolific) and the empirical field of most publications (including the most influential). If South Africa is excluded, African HE research is weak, but some communities are emerging, particularly in West, East and Southern Africa. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Now, after 100 yr of publishing, PS ranks between the top 10 journals in the category of “agriculture, dairy, and animal science”. One hundred years after publishing the first paper in PS, the poultry industry has been completely revolutionized. Hence, it will be interesting to establish scientometrics study of the PS development during the last century. Therefore, based on findings of the current study, among countries/authors’ collaborations, future research fronts, and possibility of hot topics in the coming years may be predictable. Accordingly, a total of 22,451 articles were retrieved. For content analyses, according to the PS categorization for subject areas, 14 different subject areas were developed, including “behavior, breeding and quantitative genetics, education and extension, health and welfare, immunology, management and environment, metabolism and nutrition, microbiology and virology, modeling, molecular biology, physiology and anatomy, production, products, processing and marketing, and reproduction”. Considering the 100-yr of PS, the most frequent subject area was “nutrition and metabolism” (14,109 articles), and “modeling” (1,114 articles) attracted less scholarly attention. However, considering the last decade (2011–2020), the most important subject area was “molecular biology” (1,420 of 2,466 articles; 57.58%), followed by “modeling” (544 of 1,144 articles; 48.88%). Moreover, the most frequent poultry species/strains were broilers (retrieved in 6,156 articles), followed by laying hens, turkeys, and quail. Considering collaboration of countries and researchers, it can be said that a total number of 108 countries contributed to PS, with the most prolific country being United States (with 9,421 articles; 43.16%), followed by China, Canada, the Netherlands, and Japan. Among the authors, Harms RH (287 articles), and Siegel PB (208) were the most prolific authors, and Siegel PB and Dunnington EA (71 articles) had more collaborations. To study keyword trends, including 3 time periods broilers was the central co-occurrent keyword, while the importance of chickens and turkeys declined during the time. Salmonella spp. was a constant representative of poultry microbiology during 100 yr. While “nutrition and metabolism” was the most important subject area, nutrition-related keywords (major items) were not concentrated and co-occurred with a variety of keywords from different subject areas. While “molecular biology” ranked first over the past decade, the importance of “nutrition and metabolism” should not be ignored. In fact, in recent years, molecular basis of the nutrition has been studied. In big-data era and due to developing the molecular biology technologies, it seems that using mathematical modeling and computational methodologies will increase and probably remains as one of the most attractive research areas for scientists at least in the upcoming future decades. © 2022 The Authors"

We used longitudinal publication data on 431,207 authors in four disciplines-basic medicine, biology, chemistry and clinical medicine-to quantify the differential impact of COVID-19 on the annual publishing rates of men and women. In a difference-in-differences analysis, we estimated that the average gender difference in publication productivity increased from –0.26 in 2019 to –0.35 in 2020; this corresponds to the output of women being 17% lower than the output of men in 2109, and 24% lower in 2020. An age-group comparison showed a widening gender gap for both early-career and mid-career scientists. The increasing gender gap was most pronounced among highly productive authors and in biology and clinical medicine. Our study demonstrates the importance of reinforcing institutional commitments to diversity through policies that support the inclusion and retention of women in research. ‍© Madsen et al."

The study also presented the profile of these impactful and the most prolific researchers of Pakistan. 134 highly cited and the most productive researchers constitute a group of PERs (Pakistani elite researchers). This group of elite researchers produced one-fourth of the country’s scholarly research and received 40% citations’ share over the period of study, from 2009 to 2018. Based on its findings the study provided multiple policy recommendations for researchers, research institutes, policy-makers, the government of Pakistan, and the administrators of universities. The study recommended the researchers to collaborate internationally and publish their research in good quality and open access journals for greater visibility and impact. The study further recommended enhancing the academic-corporate collaboration for user insight-based research. The study found that Islamabad based academic institutions have employed almost half of the elite researchers while the rest half of these researchers are affiliated with the institutions of the rest of the whole country. The majority of the journals publishing scholarly output of Pakistani elite researchers are based in the USA and European countries. Only 12 (0.32%) journals belonged to Pakistan. Besides international collaboration, industry collaboration was in place for this group of elite researchers. The key determinants of research quantity/quality, impact, and excellence were publications published in 1st and 2nd journals quartiles, journals having impact factor/citescore, open access publications, and international collaborations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Modern scientometric approaches allow interactive visualization of large bodies of literature to identify trends and hotspots within knowledge domains. This study thus aimed to provide a comprehensive scientometric review of the TD literature. Methods: Web of Science was searched for articles, reviews, editorials and letters with the term “tardive dyskinesia” in the title, abstract, or keywords through 12/31/2021. A total of 5,228 publications and 182,052 citations were included. Annual research output, prominent research areas, authors, affiliations and countries were summarized. VOSViewer and CiteSpace were used for bibliometric mapping and co-citation analysis. Structural and temporal metrics were used to identify key publications in the network. Results: TD-related publications peaked in the 1990s, gradually declined after 2004, and showed a further small increase after 2015. The most prolific authors were Kane JM, Lieberman JA, and Jeste DV overall (1968–2021), and Zhang XY, Correll CU and Remington G in the last decade (2012–2021). The most prolific journal was the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry overall, and the Journal of Psychopharmacology in the last decade. Knowledge clusters in the 1960–1970s dealt with clinical and pharmacological characterization of TD. In the 1980s, epidemiology, clinical TD assessment, cognitive dysfunction and animal models predominated. During the 1990s, research diverged into pathophysiological studies, especially oxidative stress, and clinical trials on atypical antipsychotics, with a focus on clozapine and bipolar disorder. In the 1990–2000s, pharmacogenetics emerged. More recent clusters include serotonergic receptors, dopamine-supersensitivity psychosis, primary motor abnormalities of schizophrenia, epidemiology/meta-analyses, and advances in TD treatment, particularly vesicular monoamine transporter-2 inhibitors since 2017. Conclusion: This scientometric review visualized the evolution of scientific knowledge on TD over more than five decades. These findings will be useful for researchers to find relevant literature when writing scientific articles, choosing appropriate journals, finding collaborators or mentors for research, and to understand the historical developments and emerging trends in TD research.

Big data exploration and mining offer numerous opportunities for engineering design; however, owing to the multitude of data sources and formats coupled with the high complexity of the design process, these techniques are yet to be utilised to the best of their full potential. In this study, a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art data-driven engineering design (DDED) in the last 20 years was conducted. A scientometric approach was employed wherein first, a systematic article acquisition procedure was performed, where a dataset of 3339 articles related to engineering design and big data analytics applications were extracted from Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. Thereafter, this dataset was reduced to a dataset of 366 articles based on concise data screening. The resulting articles were used to analyse the dynamics of research in DDED throughout the last 20 years and to detect the primary research topics related to DDED, the most influential authors, and the papers with the highest impact in the DDED domain. Furthermore, the co-occurrence network of keywords/keyphrases and co-authorship networks were constructed and analysed to reveal the interconnection of the research topics and the collaboration between the most prolific authors. Finally, an insight how big data analytics is being applied through product development activities to support decision-making in engineering design was presented. © 2022 The Authors"

College students' sleep problems, which are caused by several factors, have been easily ignored before. In the past decade, more research has been published to expand our understanding of undergraduates' sleep. The purpose of the study is to explore the research hotspots and frontiers regarding college students' sleep using CiteSpace5.8.R3 and offer guidance for future study. Methods: We retrieved relevant literature from the Web of Science Core Collection Database and imputed the downloaded files into CiteSpace5.8.R3 for visualization analysis. We generated network maps of the collaborations between authors, countries, institutions, the cited journals, and co-occurrence keywords. The analysis of keywords clusters, timeline views, and keywords citation bursts help us identify the hotspots and research trends. Results: A total of 1,841 articles related to college students' sleep, published from 2012 to 2021, were selected. The number of publications gradually increased. Karl Peltzer was the most prolific authors with 15 publications. The United States and Harvard University separately contributed 680 and 40 articles and had the greatest impact in this field. SLEEP ranked first in the frequency of cited journals. The article published by Lund HG was the most influential publication. Based on the analysis of keywords, we summarized research hotspots as follows: current status, affecting factors, and adverse outcomes of college students' sleep. The frontiers were the further understanding of the relationships between sleep and mental and physical health, and various interventions for sleep disorders. Conclusion: Our study illustrates the research hotspots and trends and calls for more research to expand the findings. In the future, the cooperation between institutions and authors needs to be strengthened. The complex relationships between sleep and mental and physical health and problematic substance use disorders are necessary to be explored. Longitudinal studies or randomized controlled trials should be constructed to verify the current findings or assumptions. Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Qu, Ji, Bu, Hu, Sun, Xue, Zhou, Qu and Liu."

The average CC and CY were 118.1 (range - 856-46) and 5.326 (range - 29.52-2.09), respectively. The 3 most prolific authors were Lang AE (Neurologist - Toronto), Lozano AM (Neurosurgeon - Toronto), and Vitek JL (Neurologist - Atlanta). The Journal of Neurosurgery published the highest number of top-cited articles [Neurology. 1960;10:61-9]. The maximum articles were from the USA. University of Toronto and Emory University were the most productive institutions. Conclusions: Pallidotomy has gone through several ebbs and flows. Unilateral pallidotomy is currently recommended for the treatment of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. The need for further research and improved technology to make the technique safer and prove its efficacy is highlighted, especially keeping in mind a large number of populations to which the prohibitively expensive deep brain stimulation is unavailable.  © 2021 S.

Despite its proliferation in the literature, little is known about the research profile of knowledge management research intertwined with sustainability. Given this gap, this article aims to conduct an extensive review of knowledge management for sustainability research. Using bibliometrics, which is suitable for large-scale reviews, this article reviews 1136 documents published in peer-reviewed journals indexed in the Web of Science between 2001 and 2021. Noteworthily, the review sheds light on the performance of research constituents (e.g., most prolific authors, countries, institutions, and journals), as well as the themes and topics underpinning the intellectual structure (i.e., knowledge foundation, knowledge creation) in the field. Specifically, the review reveals that knowledge management for sustainability research has relied on nine foundational clusters (i.e., informed sustainability practice, social network, firm performance, knowledge sharing culture, green innovation, sustainability assessment framework, global warming, knowledge management, and innovative performance) to generate new knowledge across 10 thematic clusters, (i.e., ecological knowledge, green innovation, the Shanghai Hongqiao district effect, the Agroscope Research Master Plan, food security, sustainable supply chain management, business sustainability, knowledge creation, knowledge management, and technology management). The article concludes with a new theory that encapsulates extant understanding of knowledge management for sustainability along with promising avenues for future research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

A visual knowledge graph was used to streamline the countries, institutions and authors conducting sports AI research, discipline distribution, research hotspots and development trends in the past 15 years. Subsequently, its development direction and research progress were discussed. Sports AI was widely distributed, with the US, China and the UK leading the way. The most prolific authors and teams in research on sports AI were concentrated in American universities. Their main research direction is to develop and improve smart wearable devices based on machine learning and deep learning technologies for different groups of people. Research on sports AI involved multiple disciplines, which mainly applied and referred to research methodologies and theories on engineering, computer science and sports science. It could be seen from the frequency and centrality of keywords that in the current field of sports AI, machine learning is the main direction, artificial neural networks is the main algorithm, and practical and empirical research based on data mining is the focus. The research hotspots were divided into three major clusters: physical health promotion, sports injury prevention and control, and athletic performance enhancement.

The dataset consists of works from the Web of Science database obtained by searching for “social network*”, works highly cited in the field, works published in the flagship SNA journals, and written by the most prolific authors (70,000+ publications and 93,000+ authors), up to and including 2018. Using a two-mode network linking publications with authors, we constructed and analysed different types of collaboration networks among authors. We used the temporal quantities approach to trace the development of these networks through time. The results show that most articles are written by 2 or 3 authors. The number of single authored papers has dropped significantly since the 1980s—from 70% to about 10%. The analysis of three types of co-authorship networks allowed us to extract the groups of authors with the largest number of co-authored works and the highest collaborative input, and to calculate the indices of collaborativeness. We looked at the temporal properties of the most popular nodes. We faced the problem of “multiple personalities” of mostly Chinese and Korean authors, which could be overcome with the adoption of standardized author IDs by publishers and bibliographic databases. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."

The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an unprecedented sustained challenge to supply chain management around the world, which has highlighted the importance of research on the effects of COVID-19 on supply chain management. Most of the scholarly articles were mainly focused on content analysis to discuss aspects of the research related to COVID-19 and supply chain management. The literature reviews with the bibliometric method involving supply chain management in the COVID-19 context are still scarce. In this paper, we undertook a bibliometric analysis of the research on COVID-19 and supply chain management, finding a total of 257 papers published in 2020 and 2021 to determine the thematic direction of the related flourish of research. The analysis used a combination of bibliographic and network analysis to capture the direction the research has been taking. The study identified the most highly productive authors, prominent journals, and geographic centers of publications about this phenomenon. It also examined networks related to co-authorship, countries of collaboration, co-citations and highly cited authors, and co-wording. The examination identified four thematic clusters, comprised of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains, the improvement of supply chain resilience for viability, technology and innovation for supply chain sustainability, and supply chain risk management in response to COVID-19.

Therefore, this study undertakes to review the literature on smartphone addiction research by identifying the current state of research in this domain and the future avenues that need to be addressed. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive bibliometric analysis was conducted on 652 articles extracted from SCOPUS database. Publications were extracted from Scopus by performing a keyword search of “Smartphone Addiction” OR “Problematic smartphone use”. Bibliometric methods such as performance analysis and science mapping were used to perform the overview of smartphone addiction research. In addition, VOSviewer software was used to organise, analyse and present the data. This study identifies the most prolific authors, journals, documents, collaborative work, major research themes, potential research avenues in this field of research. Findings: The result shows that the research on smartphone addiction has increased recently, the dominance of research is found in few countries only. There is preponderance of research in this domain in Asian countries, particularly South Korea and still there is a significant scope for future research in this area, which is presented in detail in this study. The research on smartphone addiction has been mainly conducted in the field of medicine and psychology; the other subjects lack behind by a significant margin in terms of research publications in this domain. The findings suggest Elhai (US) is the most influential researcher in this field, and US has shown high collaboration in smartphone addiction research with other countries as well as with authors within its domestic territory. Thematic map obtained from R software presents the evolution of themes. It shows that quality of life, social support, self-efficacy, anxiety and depression are major variables studied over the period. Respondents in most of the studies were university students, as the young generation is technology-savvy and is more attracted to gadgets such as smartphones. Research limitations/implications: This study provides an overview of research on smartphone addiction through an exhaustive bibliometric analysis to organise the fragmented literature on smartphone addiction and provide structure for future research in the domain. This is the first study of its kind on the subject. This study has found important future research avenues in the domain, which need to be addressed. Also, it will provide guidance to stakeholders from different backgrounds like, manufacturers, marketers, regulators, policymakers, consumers and academicians to contribute in controlling this problem as a part of their social responsibility.

The rate of Pristimantis species discovered annually has increased continuously during the last 50 years, establishing the remarkable diversity found in this genus. In this paper the specifics of publications describing new species in the group are examined, including authorship, author gender, year, language, journal, scientific collections, and other details. Detailed information on the descriptions of 591 species of Pristimantis published to date (June 2022) were analyzed and extracted. John D. Lynch and William E. Duellman are the most prolific authors, yet Latin American researchers have scaled up and continued the description processes since the 1990s. The most common language used for descriptions is English, followed by Spanish. The great majority of authors have described only one species. The largest proportion of authors who have participated in the descriptions is of Ecuadorian nationality. Ecuador is the country with the highest description rate per year (3.9% growth rate). Only 20% of the contributions have included women and only 2% have featured women as principal authors. 36.8% of the species described are in the Not Evaluated or Data Deficient categories under the IUCN global red list. The importance of enhancing the descriptions in Spanish is emphasized and the inclusion based on equal access to opportunities for female researchers in Pristimantis taxonomy is encouraged. In general, if the current trends in Pristimantis descriptions continue, in ten years, a total of 770 or more species described could be expected. © Carolina Reyes-Puig & Emilio Mancero."

International studies on podiatry research productivity are scarce. This study aimed to analyze scientific productivity in the area of podiatric medicine from 1965 to 2017. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational, bibliometric study. The MEDLINE database was used to identify research published between 1965 and 2017. Literature searches were performed in 2010 and 2017 through RefWorks, and research production per year, author, document type, country, institution, journal, and language were calculated. Podiatry’s contribution to global scientific production was measured by calculating the ratio of podiatry publications to total production, and Price’s law was applied to analyze the temporal evolution. Author productivity index, coauthorship, geographic distribution, and the distribution by institution type and journal (Bradford’s law) were analyzed. Results: The MEDLINE search yielded 1,256 publications, representing 4.75 articles per 100,000 publications in global scientific research. The growth rate followed Price’s law after linear adjustment. The 2,229 identified authors presented a transience index of 85.73%; 0.38% were highly productive authors. The coauthorship index increased from 1.40 in 1965 to 5.80 in 2017. The most common document type was the journal article, whereas 2.1% were clinical trials. Only one document reported a controlled clinical trial. The United States led scientific production, with 77.15% of the documents; 60.5% of the publications were concentrated in four journals. Conclusions: Podiatry is still an emerging research field, and literature is concentrated in a small number of journals, categorized into different subjects. © 2021, American Podiatric Medical Association.

Pursuant to this objective, the study classifies the publications and citation structure of the JHRM, the nature of the publications’ authorship, the most cited articles and authors and the themes that have been covered from the first day until now (2009–2021). Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses bibliometric methodologies to analyze several aspects of the JHRM. Findings: The average number of citations per paper is 4.54. The number of articles studying marketing history/practice (163) and the history of thought (158) is almost equal, consistent with the journal’s primary orientation. Compared with other journals, it could be said that JHRM achieved close ranks, especially with those of other historical journals of similar age. The most prolific authors whose articles have been published in the JHRM are used in universities located in the USA. The JHRM is closely connected to top-tier journals in the field. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to one journal (JHRM) only. However, the authors assert that the articles analyzed are representative samples of the entire school of marketing history. Another important consideration is that the value of many critical studies in the social sciences cannot be determined using only bibliometric measurements. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the marketing literature from several perspectives. First, evaluating the JHRM in terms of its unique standing shows the scope of the field of marketing history. Second, it serves as a guide for existing and future authors regarding the JHRM and the history of marketing. Third, the JHRM’s contributions provide insights into emerging trends and new opportunities for the entire marketing community. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The journal Entropy, which focuses completely on entropy and is therefore regarded as the most prominent journal, has been purposefully chosen for this study in order to examine the intellectual structure of the field. Data from the Web of Science database for the years 2008 through 2021 were gathered. Scientometric indicators, literature growth, co-authorship, co-citation, keyword co-occurrences, co-word, citation, and bibliographic coupling, are studied using VOS Viewer. Highly cited papers, most prolific authors, countries and institutions are also identified. The results of the study admit that the linear growth trend of entropy articles has increased over the course of the investigation. Highest number of the publications were contributed from China, and the institution that contributed the most articles was the Chinese Academy of Sciences. A cluster analysis of the keywords shows that the research hotspots are primarily focused on “entropy,” with the highest frequency and link strength. The high density of the co-words of “entropy,” “information,” “model” and “Shannon entropy” has also proved them to be the most mature and centralized area of entropy field. © 2022 The Author(s).

Without proper direction and guidance, it is common for students to develop deviant behaviors, non-law abidance and unhealthy beliefs. In this regard, an integral part of the educational process is the imparting of moral values and law-abiding behaviors in students. The objective of this study was to explore the role of higher education system in fostering law-abiding behavior among Chinese students, as well as the issues it causes for society. For this purpose, the principles of law-abiding behavior were studied and key psychological factors used in the system were identified. The suggestions of the bibliometric research are designed to improve and expand the method for preventing student misbehavior in educational institutions, hence enhancing the efficacy of preventative work with students. They may serve as the basis for the creation and enhancement of programs and strategies aimed at teaching lawful behavior among students. More than 3,785 articles were published related law-abiding behavior from 2000 to the end of July 2022 years were examined in this research using the Scopus database and the original sample was narrowed down to include only articles, book chapter and conference papers that contributed to law-abiding behavior and higher education literature. The VOS viewer software was used to execute the descriptive statistics and scientific mapping approaches using co-citation analysis. In the descriptive analysis, we analyzed publishing patterns over time, the geographical localization of the contributing institutions, journals, the most prolific authors. The findings of the present study may also provide the foundation for a planned educational initiative whose ultimate aim is to produce a fully realized, harmonious, self-reliant, mature, and law-abiding person. The study has provided supporting evidence for how youngsters legal sensibilities are shaped in universities have been implemented. Two distinct but interdependent educational spheres, the normative legal sphere and the space for the creation and development of students' personalities must work together to raise and educate youngsters.

Namely, the paper provides a thorough systematic literature review of energy consumption convergence, CO2 emission convergence, and energy efficiency convergence. The reason the study focuses on these three concepts is that they are interdependent. Energy consumption generates emissions, but if the former occurs in a sensible way that prioritises saving and smartness, energy efficiency is achieved. Thus, if the concept of convergence in energy consumption is to be studied thoroughly, the aspects of emissions and efficiency could not be ignored. A very detailed content analysis has been conducted to provide a snapshot and trends in many aspects. This includes the nature of the analysis, type of convergence concept, data characteristics, construction of variables, analysis framework, and the findings. Citation metrics were used for the identification of the most influential papers, authors, and articles.

For many years, our understanding of rheumatism was seriously hindered by technology constraints. However, the increasing application and rapid advancement of sequencing technology in the past decades have enabled us to study rheumatism with greater accuracy and in more depth. Sequencing technology has made huge contributions to the field and is now an indispensable component and powerful tool in the study of rheumatism. Methods: Articles on sequencing and rheumatism, published from 1 January 2000 to 25 April 2022, were retrieved from the Web of Science™ (Clarivate™, Philadelphia, PA, USA) database. Bibliometrix, the open-source tool, was used for the analysis of publication years, countries, authors, sources, citations, keywords, and co-words. Results: The 1,374 articles retrieved came from 62 countries and 350 institutions, with a general increase in article numbers during the last 22 years. The leading countries in terms of publication numbers and active cooperation with other countries were the USA and China. The most prolific authors and most popular documents were identified to establish the historiography of the field. Popular and emerging research topics were assessed by keywords and co-occurrence analysis. Immunological and pathological process in rheumatism, classification, risks and susceptibility, and biomarkers for diagnosis were among the hottest themes for research. Conclusions: Sequencing technology has been widely applied in the study of rheumatism and propells research in the area of discovering novel biomarkers, related gene patterns and physiopathology. We suggest that further efforts be made to advance the study of genetic patterns related to rheumatic susceptibility, pathogenesis, classification and disease activity, and novel biomarkers.

However, there is still a lack of literature review on the treatment of bone defect by bibliometrics in China. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the literature on the treatment of bone defect published in recent 10 years and to explore the research status, hotspots, and trends in this field, and to provide opinions and suggestions for its future development. METHODS: Using Web of Science Core Collection database as the data source and the application of bibliometrics, CiteSpace V software was used to draw the knowledge map and conduct cluster analysis of the annual trends, the distribution of nations, the distribution of research institution, the distribution of authors and the key words in the field of bone defect treatment from 2011 to 2020. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 1 743 valid articles were selected. (1) The volume of publications shows a steady rise from 2011 to 2020 in general. In terms of scientific research funds, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funded the most projects (23.81%). (2) China and Shanghai Jiao Tong University are the country and research institution with the most publications in this field respectively. USA and Chinese Academy of Sciences play the role of academic hub with the strongest centrality. (3) A total of 476 authors were included. Lei Zhang, Changsheng Liu, and Ana Claudia Muniz Renno were the most prolific researchers, but the core authors did not form a close cooperative relationship. (4) Biomaterials is the journal with the largest number of articles, and has an authoritative position in the field of biological materials. (5) Repair, regeneration, in vitro, scaffold, and mesenchymal stem cell are the research hotspots in this field. (6) Time zone analysis showed that the previous research strategies were mainly for inducing differentiation and promoting regeneration of bone defects. Since 2015, nanoparticles, hydrogels and other materials are gradually widely used in the treatment of bone defects with the help of 3D printing technology. In recent years, researchers hope to explore the mechanism of bone defect treatment at the level of signaling pathway, and hope to use new composite scaffolds combined with drug/growth factor controlled release technology to achieve better therapeutic effect. (7) The future development directions of bone defect treatment are as follows: Continue to prepare new nano-composite scaffolds with good mechanical properties by using 3D printing and other technologies; preparation of double/multiple controlled release drug and/or growth factor stents; repair large bone defects, especially those caused by cancer, while inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and other reactions; to explore the mechanism of various growth factors in bone defect repair at the signaling pathway level; basic and clinical research on osteoporosis treatment drugs. It is concluded that bone defect treatment has been paid more and more attention in recent ten years. China has played an important role in this field. The results of this study provide a new perspective for the future research in this field, and play an enlightening role for domestic researchers. © 2022, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

To study the evolution of keywords, we divided the study period into two periods of an equal number of years. In both sub-periods, the keyword “Human” stands out. In the second sub-period, the word “Perception” stands out, which indicates the current attention paid to the patient’s opinion. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Methods The CNKI, WanFang Data and VIP databases were searched from inception to December 2021. Data on the number of publications, journals, institutions, authors, keywords, and emergent themes were analyzed using bibliometric methods and CiteSpace software. Results A total of 324 studies were included. The results showed that the number of publications increased annually, and ""Chinese Journal of Medical Science Research Management"" and Peking University were the journal and institution with the most publications, respectively. The three most prolific authors published five studies each, and the publications were mainly concerned with identifying and preventing issues, in addition to education regarding medical research integrity. Conclusion Medical research integrity in China has attracted significant attention. Several leading journals in this research field have emerged; however, there is no clearly dominant research team. The depth and breadth of the research remain to be improved. It is suggested that researchers focus on the effectiveness of strategies for preventing issues, promoting the establishment of the lifelong education system and improving related rules and regulations to advance the development of medical research integrity in China. © 2022 West China University of Medical Science.

Using the bibliometric approach, the study analyses the journal's performance, citation structure, network connection, and mapping analysis through which a conceptual structure is developed. The Scopus database is used to retrieve data and a wide range of bibliometric tools are utilized for analysis such as RStudio “Biblioshiny” package, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel. Analysing IREF performance over the last twenty-nine-years (1992–2020), the findings reveal that the most prolific authors have USA and China affiliations; the journal's authors derive their information and build on research from sources that are ranked (Q1, A*, 4, 4* and SSCI), which indicates high connectedness between IREF content and published work in top sources in economics and finance. Moreover, the citation of the journal is surging in an unprecedented way during the last five years. Thus, IREF has positioned itself as one of the most influential sources, especially in finance. Its citation performance is close to the Journal of Finance, Journal of Banking and Finance, and Journal of Corporate Finance, while being above many esteemed finance journals, such as Review of Finance, Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, and Journal of Empirical Finance. The most prominent themes discussed in the journal are capital structure, economic growth, corporate governance, monetary policy, foreign direct investment, exchange rates, and emerging markets. This article presents the trending topics in IREF over the last three decades, which is helpful for the journal's board of editors in drawing a successful strategy based on a bibliometric study of the economics and finance field, where it is likely to garner interest. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

A detail bibliometric analysis of the published scientific literature indexed in Web of Science on vitamin D as a therapeutic option for the COVID-19 patients' treatment is lacking. Thus, the current study was conducted to determine the key bibliometric indices and plot the global research on vitamin D and COVID-19. Methods: The Web of Science Core Collection database was utilized to retrieve publications on vitamin D and COVID-19. A Boolean search strategy was applied and the obtained data were exported to Microsoft Excel to generate relevant graphs. Furthermore, VOSviewer software version 1.6.17 for Windows was used to generate co-authorship countries, bibliographic coupling sources and co-occurrence keyword network visualization mapping. In addition, RStudio and Bibliometric online tool were used to generate WordCloud and thematic map, and intercountries relation map, respectively. Results: A total of 818 publications on vitamin D and COVID-19 were included in the final analysis. These publications were cited 10,713 times, with an H-index of 50. The number of publications and citations score from 2020 to November 2021 increased from 317 (2423 citations) to 501 (8290 citations). Delanghe JR and Speeckaert MM were the most prolific authors with 13 publications each. The most productive journal was Nutrients (n = 63). The most studied research area is nutrition dietetics. The most widely used author keywords were COVID-19 (n = 444), Vitamin D (n = 312), and SARS-CoV-2 (n = 190). The National Institute of Health and US Department of Health and Human Services were the leading funding agencies. Harvard University was the most active institution with 25 publications. The United States of America was the highly contributing and influential country in terms of publications (n = 203) and total link strength (n = 185). Conclusion: It was concluded that an increasing trend in the number of publications on vitamin D and COVID-19 has been observed. Significantly, the majority of the research has been conducted in developed countries. Most importantly, over the time, the direction of research has been changed and the recent trend topics are vitamin D deficiency, risk and infection, and vitamin D supplementation based on KeyWords Plus. The use of vitamin D supplement is one of the promising therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, the current study not only highlight the global research trends but also provide standard bibliographic information for future studies. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

More than 1,400 PubMed-indexed documents have been authored by about 5,800 unique authors, averaging around 120 publications per month. This sheer rise in the number led us to explore the content published in the literature. We discovered more than 30% of the documents are Quantitative Productivity (QP) i.e., papers that illustrate the emerging trends of parachute concerns, modified salami tactics, cyclic recycling, and excellence in redundancy. In addition, we found few common hyper-prolific authors previously identified in the COVID-19 literature. Further, we share our experience in publishing monkeypox literature and highlight the growing readership and citation interest in editorials, commentaries, and correspondences that were thought to be uncitable in the medical literature. As long as the scientific community and public demand, the supply of such papers will continue, with no responsibility on the authors, journals, or the reader. Since overhauling the current system is an arduous task, we propose the optimization of existing retrieval services that would selectively filter documents based on article type (requires standardization of definitions) to dilute the crowding out effects of quantitative productivity. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Despite a substantial rise in the academic literature on OA, the nuanced understanding of OA among academicians, practitioners and policymakers is limited. To address this research gap, the current study attempts to synthesize the academic literature on organizational literature, understand the evolution of OA literature and state the potential research gaps that may open multiple research avenues. Design/methodology/approach: The current study critically evaluates academic literature published in peer-reviewed journals using the bibliometric approach to map the intellectual structure of identified 224 articles on published literature on OA between 2001 and 2022. Findings: The findings outline OA's evolutionary trend, most prolific authors, journals, affiliations and countries. Further, network analysis is deployed to unearth prominent OA themes. After that, four key themes of OA from each cluster have been identified and evaluated. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on the literature drawn from the SCOPUS database. Although the SCOPUS database is one of the largest databases, the authors believe that the SCOPUS does not contain some publications that might have offered some different insights. Secondly, the bibliometric analysis does not offer the opportunity to provide critical insights into published literature, which is one of the main limitations of bibliometric-based studies. However, despite some of these limitations, the authors believe that the study is a useful guide for scholars, practitioners and policymakers who do not have much information related to OA literature.

This is due to the relevant performances in terms of physico-mechanical properties comparable to traditional construction materials (e.g., ordinary Portland cement). The sustainability of AAMs is often highlighted since they can be developed by using many natural or industrial by-products–based precursors. This leads to challenges with the optimization of AAM production due to their different performances, availability, and costs. However, they are flexible and locally adapted materials. The research interest in AAMs has rapidly increased in the early 2000s. In recent years, about 1,000 international articles have been published each year. This study aims at assessing the gender balance of this specific research topic to investigate the relevance of women’s participation. Author lists of the published articles were analyzed throughout the Scopus database, applying “alkali-activated material” and “geopolymers” as keywords in the titles, abstracts, and keywords search. The last 10 years (2009–2019) were taken into account. The gender of the most prolific authors was analyzed, and a focus of European authors on this topic was considered, as more than 25% of the research in AAMs have been carried out in Europe. The analysis of 5,900 publications in the last decade shows that there is currently a shift toward men in the gender balance in this specific research, and female authors only covered 22% of the most productive authors worldwide. Considering European authors, a more equal gender distribution is reached, when the first author is considered, with a concentration of women in the range of 36–56%, recorded over 1,396 articles. © Copyright © 2020 Masi, Manzi and Bignozzi."

This study reviews the articles published by the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Institute (EMRI) to map and summarize the evidence, identify key themes and highlight research gaps to plan future research. Method: We searched for studies affiliated with EMRI on osteoporotic fracture. Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database (SID) and Persian databases were used, without restricting time and language. All papers published up to December 2019 were retrieved and merged using Endnote software. Two independent researchers reviewed documents, and non-related papers were removed from the collection. The reference lists of the relevant articles were reviewed to avoid missing any publication. All papers addressing any aspects of fragility fractures were included. Meeting abstracts and letters to the editor were excluded. The visualization of the co-authorship network was illustrated with VOSveiwer program software. Results: The total number of 20 papers, published between 2004 and 2019 were included in our study. “Larijani, B” with 12, “Keshtkar, A”, “Abolhassani, F”, and “Soltani, A” with five papers were the most prolific authors. Six out of 20 (30 %) of the papers were published in the last three years. Among different perspectives of osteoporotic fractures, addressed by EMRI, four main categories of articles were defined including incidence (n = 7), related factors (n = 9), fracture risk assessment (n = 2), and the burden of osteoporotic fractures in Iran (n = 4). There was no updated information about the incidence of osteoporotic fracture and its burden in recent years. Conclusions: Considering the importance of osteoporotic fractures in Iran with an ageing trend, Osteoporosis Research Centers can play an essential role in providing evidence for policymakers. Worldwide, there is a large care gap to assess bone health and start treatments after fragility fractures. Accordingly, following international recommendations, practical interventions are required to fill this gap. EMRI began developing the “Registry of osteoporosis” and also pilot the “Fracture Liaison Services”, as an operative model to address the existing care gap and implement applied research in this science area. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

As such, global references in this field are identified and highlighted in order to manage pre-existing knowledge and establish future ‘bridges’ among researchers, and to enhance the presently dispersed understanding of this subject. A scientometric meta-analysis of publications on technostress was conducted to achieve this objective. Mainstream journals from the Web of Science (WoS) were used to identify current topics, relevant journals, prolific authors, institutions, and countries, ‘schools of thought’ and the thematic areas around which current technostress debate revolves. In this article a significant contribution comes from the use of the scientific activity itself, together with scientometric meta-analysis techniques and the application of this scientific activity, its impact and relational character, to discover relevant countries, research organizations and authors which can constitute a global reference to demarcate this knowledge frontier, and who lead the ‘critical mass’ of global technostress researchers. This study also distinguishes between the relevant themes studied, with co-keywords plus bibliographic coupling citation, and examines the kind of stress the most prolific authors have considered and, therefore, to discover those topics which should be studied further to deepen this research field, in search of a post-disciplinary knowledge that allows unity of focus in technology and psychology. © 2020 by the authors.

Consequently, there have been considerable discussions on task shifting, sharing, and delegation. Aims: The purpose of this study was to identify underlying thematic structures of task shifting research, provide information on the most prolific authors, illuminate connections between peers, and map the general investigated themes and how they have changed over time. Methods: A mixed-method bibliographic analysis of the scholarship contributions of both the medical and nursing professions on task shifting was performed using bibliometrics. Results: A total of 1,833 unique articles contributed to the corpus of literature with increased rates of scholarship on task shifting being associated with the publication of the declaration of Alma Ata and the World Health Report of 2006. Scholarship on the topic is widely dispersed globally and illustrates that groups of authors regularly collaborate on (a) the application of task shifting to populations/groups (both disease and condition oriented), (b) the various human resources for health and care intervention reform, (c) the underpinning regulatory changes and, (d) the pursuit of universal health coverage. Conclusions: This analysis identifies key areas of strength in the current literature and the role of regulation in the delivery and redistribution of responsibilities within nursing and across disciplines. Up until this point, the work on task shifting has given only limited consideration to the use of technology as a means of generating more comprehensive solution sets. The need to include technology solutions as part and parcel of future research studies should be pursued. © 2020 National Council of State Boards of Nursing"

Firstly, publication trends are reported; then, possible socio-economic relevant sectors arising from this information are determined. Lastly, indicators that can be used in foresight exercises to evaluate the potential nanotechnology research areas in South Africa are examined. The 20-year review is also compared with the recent past year, 2019, to identify any changing trends. South Africa’s nanotechnology publications per year grew exponentially from 68 papers in 2000 to 1672 in 2019, an increase of 2459%. The total share of nanotech publications increased from 1.4% in 2000 to 6.6% in 2019, thus a 0.52% increase per year. Compared with Brazil, Russia, India and China, the BRICS countries, South Africa has the lowest nanotechnology productivity with an activity index of 0.68. Over the last 5 years, South Africa nanotech publications had a Hirsch-index of 94 and an average citations rate of 12.76 per paper. Universities are the most prominent publishers, and there are very few publications from the private sector, which can negatively impact the commercialisation of nanotechnology research. The top 10 most prolific researchers, author or co-author over 20% of the nanotechnology papers are reported. A mixture of old and new top researchers’ names suggests succession planning in the system as the years progress. The emergence of computer science as one of the top 20 subjects publishing in nanotech in 2019 and a high level of researcher collaboration suggests possible convergence of nanotech, information technology and artificial intelligence in South Africa. The strategic socio-economic-focused nanotechnology research areas identified for South Africa include material science, photoluminance and optics, medicine, catalysis, electronics, energy, biotech, magnetism, sensors, water and communicable diseases. The top collaborating countries, top researchers, top institutions and nanotechnology economic hubs are reported for each strategic research area. The level of innovation was evaluated using the nanotechnology value chain, and there is a meagre 3.5% of papers reporting on nano-enabled products. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

From 2006 to 2019, researches of Chinese agricultural heritage had progressed in three stages: initial exploration, rapid growth, and steady development. In regard to journal carriers, a core group was formed of eight journals, which included ""Agricultural History of China"" ""China Agricultural University Journal of Social Sciences Edition"" ""Resources Science"" ""Chinese Journal of Eco-Agriculture"", and ""Journal of Resources and Ecology"". The Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Nanjing Agricultural University, for example, played important roles in academic research. And MIN Qingwen, WANG Siming, and their team members were among the most prolific authors. Meanwhile, agricultural heritage conservation and utilization, tourism development, and value assessment were the most common research focuses; and case studies were mainly concentrated in Yunnan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Guangxi, and other provinces with globally and nationally important agricultural heritage systems. In respect to research methods, case studies and qualitative analysis were the most common. In the future, researchers should 1) continue to perform basic theoretical studies about the definition, classification, conservation mechanisms, and patterns of agricultural heritage; 2) develop new areas of agricultural heritage research, including investigation of its spatial and temporal evolution, development of monitoring and warning mechanisms, and assessment of economic-social-cultural-ecological environmental effects; 3) strengthen the research on agricultural heritage of key regions (e.g., ""the Belt and Road"" ""the Grand Canal"" ""the Yellow River Basin"", and ""the Yangtze River Economic Belt"") to meet the significant national strategic development needs; and 4) broaden research horizons by facilitating the integration of multidisciplinary theories, methods, technologies, and comprehensive applications and by establishing integrated agricultural heritage research communities. © 2020, Science Press.

Specifically, the article analyzes indicators that measure the nature of the scientific output of Mindfulness, by investigating the following metrics: characteristics of articles; thematic areas; characteristics of samples and methods; most recurring variables; nature of authorship; most prolific authors; and most influential articles and countries. Methods: The study was conducted with the use of bibliometric analysis tools. The analysis began with a review of all articles published in Mindfulness between March 2010 and March 2019, in addition to articles available online but not yet assigned to an issue. Post-hoc inspections were also performed with the use of integrated machine learning algorithms. Results: There is an increase in the proportion of empirical studies, and psychology is the most explored field of study. There is also an intensification of more rigorous research designs and methods. Different segments of society are gaining representation in the samples investigated, and sample sizes have been increasing over the years. Mindfulness is the most recurring predictor variable, but no one single outcome variable stands out. The trend is away from single-authored articles, and the geographic distribution of Mindfulness’ articles has widened over time. Yet, a core of frequently published authors consistently select Mindfulness as the medium for mobilizing their research. Conclusion: Taken together, results show that Mindfulness is constantly growing as a reputable source of scholarly, rigorous scientific research in its domain. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Our study aims to explicate the knowledge creation dynamics (structure and networks) of JBR special issues (SIs) and regular issues (RIs) between 1973 and 2020. Applying bibliometrics, we examine the knowledge structure of JBR SIs by identifying their highly cited publications, prolific authors, and affiliations. In addition, using co-authorship, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses, we investigate the knowledge structures prevailing among the sources citing JBR, its contributing authors, and their affiliations. Our findings indicate that the most prolific authors have US affiliations and that JBR has stronger ties with other leading marketing and management journals, such as the Journal of Marketing, the Journal of Consumer Research, the Journal of Marketing Research, Strategic Management Journal, and Industrial Marketing Management. Bibliographic coupling groups the JBR SI publications into seven clusters identified as consumer behavior of emerging technologies, organizational resources and networks, dynamics of consumer power in marketing, measurement issues, globalization of marketing, future-oriented strategies and tools, and market relationships. Finally, a comparison of JBR SIs with RIs highlights scholarship from more countries with a focus on evolving and current topics. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

It would be also worth analyzing which countries and authors have been mainly contributing to the topic, and what publication types are mostly used to convey research in that area. Even though there are numerous literature reviews regarding project communication issues and different aspects of virtual teams, there is no one dedicated specifically to the topic of communication in virtual project teams. Aim - the paper aims to identify the scientific output in the area of communication in virtual project teams from the last 20 years (2001-2020) and analyze it for its volume, geographic distribution, publication types, areas and types of research and contributing authors. Method - a bibliometric approach has been applied to answer the research questions regarding the number of publications in the studied period, most contributing countries and most prolific authors, prevailing publication types and research topics addressed in the studied literature. Three databases - Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were used to search for publications about communication in virtual project teams and the refined results from these databases were combined into the final dataset which was then analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. Contribution - the results of the bibliometric review of research on communication in virtual teams show that the most frequently undertaken topics concern methods and tools for communication in virtual teams, while issues linking communication with trust or leadership are the least explored areas. © 2021 The Authors.

Methods: Publications on multiple sclerosis nursing were retrieved by using a bibliometric method based on the Web of Science database [1900–2018]. Results: A total of 825 papers collected from 49 countries were retrieved in this study. The number of publications on multiple sclerosis nursing has increased steadily since 1999, and the top 12 research institutions publishing articles and nine of the ten most prolific authors were from the United States. Articles were most frequently published in the Journal of Neuroscience Nursing, and the key words of the top 10 highly cited papers changed from quality of life (QOL) and symptoms to terms including social support, psychological problems, rehabilitation treatment, cognitive impairment, and nursing intervention. While nursing practice and neuroscience nursing were the focus of research, other topics included QOL, functional rehabilitation, symptom management, nursing intervention, and support schemes. Conclusions: Research into multiple sclerosis nursing in China is at an early stage. Greater attention to the research focus and results of top institutions and core journals, and a focus on highly cited papers are needed to advance the field. © Annals of Palliative Medicine.

The study adopted a desktop research methodology based on literature review and bibliographic data from WoS database. Bibliometric indicators discussed include yearly productivity, most prolific authors, and enhanced countries. Study findings revealed that research activity in the field of agriculture and open access is very low. There were 36 OA articles and only 6 publications had an open data badge. Most researchers do not yet embrace the need to openly publish their data set despite the availability of numerous open data repositories. Unfortunately, most African countries are still lagging behind in management of agricultural open data. The study therefore recommends that researchers should publish their research data sets as OA. African countries need to put more efforts in establishing open data repositories and implementing the necessary policies to facilitate OA. © 2021, IGI Global."

This is not only a problem of the Spanish university, but is widespread throughout the world, so it is necessary to know and analyse the reasons that lead to this fact in order to be able to alleviate this university dropout. Method: a quantitative-bibliometric methodology was used to explore the Web of Science and retrieve 182 scientific articles in the area of educational research for the study sample during the period from 2002 to 2021. The information sources, authors and keywords of the articles were taken as variables to carry out the relevant analyses with the RStudio and VOSviewer programmes. Results: the main journals in which the articles are published are identified, as well as the most prolific authors in the topic of university dropout. A factorial approach is carried out with the key words of the articles where we identify the main topics and problems that can lead to university students dropping out of their studies, such as certain educational policies, the rise of distance education, academic failure in basic educational stages or social, personal, psychological or economic variables. Conclusions: four main components are behind university dropout: academic failure, learning methodologies, impact and dropout. From these, specific problems to be taken into account and be the object of study and analysis, such as, among others, certain educational policies, the new virtual environments, school failure in the basic stages or various academic and personal variables. © 2021 University of Granada.

The total number of publications and citations are used to assess productivity, in terms of the number of publications, influence, and the number of citations of both authors and countries. Network maps were created using the VOSViewer software examining patterns of co–authorship, co–citation and keyword co–occurrence. The results indicate that the most prolific authors, in terms of the number of publications, are not necessarily producing the most profound research that gains traction through citations in the field.

This study aims to achieve a better understanding of the publications focused on veterans from 1989 to 2018 using a PubMed-based bibliometric analysis of research articles on veterans. Methods: We searched the PubMed website for publications in journal article category from 1989 through 2018, indexed with the MeSH descriptor, “Veterans” or “Veterans Health”. Recorded articles were retrieved and analyzed. Results: During the period 1989-2018, there were 12 710 articles related to veterans or veterans’ health, up from 66 articles in 1989 to 1225 articles in 2018. Of all the selected articles, 5242 (41.24%) can be classified under research support by the US government, 2773 (21.81%) by non-US government, and 1700 (13.38%) by the Office of Extramural Research (OER) of the National Institutes of Health. Of the 15 most prolific authors, 14 were affiliated with the US institutions. The journal that published the highest number of articles related to veterans was the journal Military Medicine (504 articles, 3.97%), followed by the Journal of Traumatic Stress (397 articles, 3.12%), Psychiatric Services (Washington, D.C.) (299 articles, 2.35%), and Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development (279 articles, 2.20%). Among all publications, 18.04% (n = 2293) were published in journals of psychiatry, followed by 13.51% (n = 1717) of psychology and 7.71% (n = 980) of neurology. Conclusion: Publications related to veterans increased significantly from 1989 to 2018. A considerable number of the publications were in journals of psychiatric and psychological categories. However, most publications were descriptive of US veterans. Future research related to veterans in Taiwan deserves further exploration to provide a reference for prioritization of the health care and policy making.

The greatest growth of publication rate occurred from 2014 to 2015. The countries with the most contribution have been the United Kingdom, the United States, and Sweden. The publications have been concentrated primarily in twelve journals. The bibliometric map of keywords presented them grouped into six clusters. Several underlying factors like technical and managerial aspects, planning, and leadership can explain the main barriers for the implementation of the Lean System. According to the literature, the understanding of such barriers is the best way to reduce the implementation-time and reach profitability and competitiveness. Therefore, the main contribution of this work is to make the evolution and importance of publications in this area are better known, helping organizations in the knowledge of the Lean System implementation barriers present in the literature, and in reformulating the curricula of undergraduate and postgraduate in disciplines related to Lean System.

One of the forms of scientific co-operation is co-authorship that involves the production of a scientific output by several collaborative researchers and scholars. This research has been designed to map out co-authorship networks in the Hamadan University of Medical Sciences researches indexed in the Web of Science from 2012 to 2016, and analyzes scientific collaboration and co-authorship networks in this university. Method: The present study is an applied study which has been carried out using the scientometric indicators and social network analysis. The statistical population of this research consisted of all the scientific articles that at least one of the authors of referred to the Hamadan University of Medical Sciences as the affiliation and indexed in the Web of Science from 2010 to 2016. In so doing, the network analysis technique and the software on Citespace and Gephi were run to analyze and visualize co-authorship networks. Furthermore, the software on HISTCITE was used for data analysis. Findings: All articles related to Hamadan University of Medical Sciences during the years 2012 to 2016, based on a search on the Web of Science, have 838 records. The dominant co-authorship pattern in these years is the 4 and 5 authors with 171 articles and 20.41%. The mean number of authors or collaboration index in the period considered was 5.51, the degree of Collaboration was 0.99 and the Collaborative Coefficient was 0.759. Poorolajal, Alikhani and Shahidi were the most prolific authors. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University and Islamic Azad University were the most prolific organizations. The greatest collaboration of Iranian researchers has been with Switzerland. Saidijam, Mahjub, Mehdizadeh, and Moghimbeigi have alloacated the highest betweenness centrality, whereas Saidijam, Mahjub, Hajilooi, and Khazaei have allocated the highest degree centrality. Conclusion: The scientific production of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences during the period from 2012 to 2016 has grown dramatically, and collaborative research at this university is growing at an appropriate level. In this study, the degree of Collaboration and the co-operation rate are high which indicates that here is a great deal of interest in co-authorship and co-operation among researchers of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, and it is relatively unlikely to see single-authorship, which reflects the willingness of individuals to co-authorship. © 2018 Library Philosophy and Practice."

The growth of the field warrants an objective mapping of contributions to the literature and the identification of trends. We conduct a systematic review of the literature of behavioral operations and supply chain management (BOSCM) across eight key operations and supply chain management journals, with publication dates through the end of June 2018. Collected articles are categorized into 12 operations contexts as well as emerging topic considerations. Key research trends, theoretical foundations, and methodological choices are discussed in each context. The results show that supply chain management, inventory management, and procurement/auctions have been the most popular operations contexts for BOSCM researchers. The results of our co-citation analysis shows that the fundamental research areas that have informed and shaped the field include supply chain risk management, marketing, cognitive psychology, and social psychology. Based on these findings and a survey of the most prolific authors in the field, we discuss possible avenues for future research. © 2019 Decision Sciences Institute"

Objective: This study utilises a bibliometric approach to systematically and comprehensively evaluate the literature on TMS from the last three decades. Methods: The Scopus citation database was used to identify all peer-reviewed journal articles concerning TMS over the period 1988–2017. Frequency-distribution, cross-tabulation and keyword analyses were performed to determine the most prolific researchers, institutions, nations, journals and the foremost studied disease entities within the TMS field. Given recent heightened awareness of gender bias across many fields of biomedicine, female representation among the most prolific authors was determined. Open-access publication rates and types of study design utilised were also quantified. Results: 17,492 TMS-related articles were published during the study period 1988–2017. The annual TMS research output has increased dramatically over this time, despite a recent levelling-off of publications per year. The most prolific institutions were based in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. The top disease entities studied were stroke, depression and Parkinson's disease. Only 4/52 of the most productive researchers during the study period were female. A minority (4.81%) of publications were published as gold open-access. Conclusion: This study implemented a systematic, bibliometric approach to quantitively assess the breadth of the TMS literature base and identify temporal publication and authorship trends. Drawing on these insights may aid understanding of historical progress in TMS over the last 30 years and help identify into unmet needs and opportunities to improve scientific and publishing practices to contribute to the future health of the field. These findings are likely to be relevant to researchers, clinicians, funders, industry collaborators and other stakeholders. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."

Using bibliometric techniques, we analyze the journal's impact, its prominent topics and most prolific authors including their affiliated institutions and countries. We also identify the bibliographic couplings of authors and their affiliated institutions and countries, co-citations of journals, and co-occurrences of the authors’ specified keywords. Our results show that about 83% of the published works receiving at least one citation between 1994 and 2018 and about 68% are co-authored. Among the important themes discussed in RFE, the words “stock”, “market,” and “risk” occupy central positions in RFE publications.

The following journals were included: International Journal of Nursing Studies, Nurse Education Today, Journal of Nursing Scholarship, Nursing Outlook, Worldviews on Evidence-Based Nursing and the Journal of Advanced Nursing. Background: In the nursing field, bibliometric analysis and maps have been used to analyse the production of some journals but not for the comparison of different journals. Design/Method: Using descriptive bibliometrics, we studied scientific production of different journals and bibliometric maps were used to visualize the content of published articles. Results: The six journals included showed that 3,937 articles were written by 1,1371 authors from 2,980 institutions and 84 countries from 2012 – 2017. Journal of Advanced Nursing had a greater number of publications and citations. The most prolific authors showed a tendency to publish first in Journal of Advanced Nursing and then in International Journal of Nursing Studies and Nurse Education Today. The frequency of citation was higher in International Journal of Nursing Studies followed by Journal of Advanced Nursing. The most collaborative authors and those with the most co-citations published more than half of their publications in Journal of Advanced Nursing. The topics most commonly researched by these authors were job satisfaction, collaborative practices, and nurse leaders. Conclusion: This bibliometric analysis contributes to the understanding of the current state of nursing research and its evolution.                          © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Methods: A scoping bibliometric review of documents retrieved using Google Scholar was conducted, limited to publications that contained the word ‘ResearchGate’ in their title and were published from 2008 to 2017. Results: The search yielded 159 documents, once a preliminary list of 386 documents retrieved from Google Scholar was filtered, which eliminated about 60% of the results that were bibliographic citations and not documents. Papers in journals were the most numerous type of documents (n = 73; 46%), followed by conference papers (n = 31; 19.5%). Contributing eight publications, two Spanish scholars (Delgado López-Cózar and Orduña-Malea, who were co-authors in each case) were the most prolific authors writing on this topic during the ten-year period. The keywords most used in the documents were ‘ResearchGate’ and ‘Altmetrics’. The publications were cited frequently since 2014 (more than 90% of the total cites fell in that period), and those with more than one author were the most cited ones. The authors of the documents were mainly librarians and information science professionals, who wrote primarily as co-authors with colleagues from their own institutions, mostly published in English. Conclusions: Interest in ResearchGate has grown since 2015, as evident from the number of articles published and the citations they received. © EASE 2019."

Research suggests that parents need training and support in order to raise, educate and socialize their offspring. A solution to these needs may be found in parental education offered from the perspective of positive parenting. This study aims to show a global and general map of the scientific production related to group parental education programs. To do so we have carried out a systematic review following the guidelines of the PRISMA guide and the Cochrane and Campbell collaborations. The search is limited mainly to articles in English and Spanish and published in refereed journals between 2006 and 2019. Eight electronic databases were consulted: ERIC, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, WOS, SCIELO, KCI, PsycARTICLES and PsycINFO. After the selection process, 245 research articles were included. The results highlight the most prolific authors, the journals with the most publications and the 48 countries where research had been carried out, belonging to America, Oceania, Europe, Asia and Africa. Regarding the design of the studies, 60% were pre-experimental or quasi-experimental. We have also identified 115 group interventions that were implemented and evaluated. What we find is a growing trend in scientific production on the subject, and this includes the discovery of research carried out in lower income countries. In addition to observing that not all interventions were in the same stage of consolidation, we have also identified those programs that have been most widely implemented and evaluated internationally. These programs, which tend to coincide with those defined as models by reference guides, are complemented by other promising approaches. © 2020, Ministry Education and Science. All rights reserved."

Design/methodology/approach: Researchers generated a comprehensive list of the articles published between 2010 and 2017 in the field of “urban education” by searching the Social Sciences Citation Index database, using the keywords of “urban” and “education.” As an additional criterion, all the articles published between 2010 and 2017 in the journals of Urban Education and Education and Urban Society were included. Findings: There are a total of 2,123 publications that were checked and retrieved in the field of “urban education” between 2010 and 2017. Although the number of publications differs year by year, the sum of the citations received the increase from year to year on a regular basis. There are 35 articles that were cited more than h-index, as h-classics in this field for this period and top 10 of these h-classics are reported in this study. Urban Education and Education and Urban Society were revealed as the most prominent journals in the field of urban education. Also, the results show that the most cited articles, the most prolific authors and organizations, and top journals in this field are from the USA. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this study is not extensive enough, and the data obtained are not comprehensive enough. The survey was limited to the keyword of “urban education” in the fields of title, abstract, author keywords and keywords plus. Practical implications: This bibliometric analysis contributes to the literature of urban education through a historical perspective. Results show that the “urban education” field attracts more attention of the researchers and the impacts of these publications are increasing from year to year. Also, there is a prevalence of the USA in the field of urban education.

Literature examining how firms are adopting OI practices is rich; notwithstanding, little research has addressed this topic from the perspective of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given the relevance of SMEs in worldwide economies, the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of research on OI in SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 112 academic articles were selected from the Web of Science database. Following a bibliometric analysis, the most relevant authors, journals, institutions and countries are presented. Additionally, the main areas these articles cover are summarized. Findings: Results are consistent in that the most prolific authors are affiliated with the universities leading the ranking of institutions. However, it is remarkable that top authors in this field do not possess a large number of publications on OI in SMEs, but combine this research topic with other related ones. At the country level, European countries are on the top together with South Korea. Research limitations/implications: Despite following a rigorous method, other relevant documents not included in the selected databases might have been ignored. Practical implications: This paper outlines the main topics of interest within this area: impact of OI on firm performance and on organizations’ structure, OI as a mechanism to hasten new product development, the analysis of the inbound/outbound dimensions of OI, and legal issues related to intellectual property right management when OI is implemented.

In this paper, we use the CiteSpace social network tool and co-authorship data from the Web of Science to analyse two such types of community. The first type is based on the cited publications of a group of highly productive authors in a particular discipline, and the second on the uncited publications of those highly productive authors. These pairs of communities were generated for three different countries—the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA)—and for four different disciplines (as denoted by Web of Science subject categories)—Chemistry Organic, Engineering Environmental, Economics, and Management. In the case of the UK and USA, the structures of the cited and uncited communities in each of the four disciplines were markedly different from each other; in the case of the PRC, conversely, the cited and uncited PRC communities had broadly similar structures that were characterised by large groups of connected authors. We suggest that this may arise from a greater degree of guest or honorary authorship in the PRC than in the UK or the USA. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."

Given that the organisms that evaluate said research use the quality of the dissemination channels used as a criterion, the international criteria for publication used by journals included in the Web of Science (WoS) make them very appealing to publish in. This paper undertook to examine the scientific output of psychology in Mexico through a sample of 479 members of the SNI (Sistema Nacional de Investigadores) belonging to the field of psychology. This was done by examining by SNI level, gender and university through article records in the Web of Science. The results reveal that the number of articles from the most prolific researchers in Mexico ranges from 36 to 82, and that women, who happened to comprise 60% of the sample, outnumber men in each of the areas analyzed and show slightly greater productivity. The practical value of the study lies in gaining a quantitative overview of the scientific activity in the national field of psychology, as well as understanding its publication dynamics in the WoS, so that this information can serve as a reference with an objective criterion of quality. © 2018 Fundación Universitaria Konrad Lorenzorg/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)."

Nevertheless, it is not easy to understand what is the current state of the art of engineering education based on research that is being made in specific regions of the world. Considering that engineering educators are practitioners of EE and sometimes also researchers in EER subfields, this discussion paper aims to make an analysis of the state of the art with respect to EER in European countries, higher education institutions, authors and journals. The approach chosen was to make an exploratory study based on document research using Elsevier Scopus indexing service. Considering the Scopus database, the time threshold was defined as 1970 to 2017. Using the search-term 'engineering education' was possible to identify 19074 journal documents, being 4604 from European affiliated authors. Based on the study the authors conclude that EER is growing in Europe and have outreached the USA in the last years, but the relative position to the whole world is decreasing. Additionally, it was possible to identify the most prolific authors, countries and institutions. Notable, in the last 10 years Spain become the country with the higher number of published papers. The analysis of the keywords showed that there is a strong focus in computer-based tools to support engineering education.

We sought to determine how often the 20 most prolific American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR) authors from 2013 to 2017 published in clinical journals and the extent to which their articles were disseminated into the clinical literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We counted all authors’ first- or senior-authored articles in the AJNR from 2013 to 2017 to identify the 20 most prolific authors in AJNR. We searched for these 20 authors’ total articles from 2013 to 2017 to determine which were published in radiology or clinical journals and the number of citations received from radiology and clinical journals. Authors were sorted into quartiles according to these metrics, and other descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: The top 20 AJNR authors contributed to 1463 articles during 5 years, including 711 (48.6%) in radiology and 752 (51.4%) in clinical journals. These articles were cited 15,857 times, including 4659 (29.3%) by articles in radiology journals. The more prolific authors published in clinical journals more often (Spearman 0.65, P .002) and were cited more ( 0.42, P .07). Articles published in clinical journals were cited more often (mean, 12.3 clinical, 9.3 radiology general versus 8.7 in AJNR), and whether published in radiology or clinical journals, they were cited more frequently by clinical journals. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of where it is published, radiology research is disseminating into the clinical realm.

The findings present the most prolific authors in the Southern African region and the prominence of their outputs on e-governance. The study, through the computational synthesis of the data, also reveals some of the missing links in e-governance research designs and implementation. Furthermore, the study indicates that the service-oriented design of e-government platforms are still lacking, and the integration of Information Technology (IT) alignment, which is necessary to successfully implement e-government is lacking. The use and integration of mobile technology to enhance citizen-centric and participatory public governance platform and egovernment implementation is not sufficiently addressed. Therefore, there is need to measure the maturity level of e-government IT deployment, its user-interfaces, as well as the design of an egovernment that is able to respond to often embryonic and heterogeneous needs of citizens. © 2019 Library Philosophy and Practice."

The top three most prolific authors are Guangze Jin (70 papers), Keping Ma (68 papers), and Zhanqing Hao (68 papers). The most active research institutions are the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (104 papers), the Institute of Applied Ecology of CAS (67 papers), and the South China Botanical Garden of CAS (59 papers). CForBio-associated institutions and scholars cooperate infrequently, and cross-unit collaborative research needs improvement. The core research topics of CForBio focus on patterns of tree spatial distribution, plant functional traits, tree density dependence, and community phylogeny; these topics provide a theoretical basis for elucidating the mechanisms of forest community assembly among the different climatic zones in China. In the future, CForBio should strengthen cooperation among institutions-both domestic and abroad, establish data sharing pathways, further emphasize new technologies and techniques such as near-surface remote sensing and multi-source data fusion, and continue to fund research on the multi-scale and multi-dimensional analysis of biodiversity patterns, plant-soil feedback mechanisms, and tree canopy and root structure function. © 2018, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The Lancet (n = 3593; 9.1%), the Journal of Clinical Oncology (n = 3343; 8.5%) and The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 3275 articles; 8.3%) published the largest number of RCTs. A total of 154 countries were involved in the production of articles. The global productivity ranking was led by the United States (n = 18,393 articles), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 8028 articles), Canada (n = 4548 articles) and Germany (n = 4415 articles). Seventeen authors who had published 100 or more articles were identified; the most prolific authors were affiliated with Duke University (United States), Harvard University (United States) and McMaster University (Canada). The main funding institutions were the National Institutes of Health (United States), Hoffmann-La Roche (Switzerland), Pfizer (United States), Merck Sharp & Dohme (United States) and Novartis (Switzerland). The 100 most cited RCTs were published in nine journals, led by The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 78 articles), The Lancet (n = 9 articles) and JAMA (n = 7 articles). These landmark contributions focused on novel methodological approaches (e.g. the ""Bland-Altman method"") and trials on the management of chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes control, hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, multiple therapies for diverse cancers, cardiovascular therapies such as lipid-lowering statins, antihypertensive medications, and antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy). Conclusions: Our analysis identified authors, countries, funding institutions, landmark contributions and high-impact-factor medical journals publishing RCTs. Over the last 50 years, publication production in leading medical journals has increased, with Western countries leading in research but with low- and middle-income countries showing very limited representation. © 2020 The Author(s)."

In total, 1822 papers published in 352 journals over the past 25 years were analyzed for scientific output; citations; subject categories; major journals; outstanding keywords; and leading countries, institutions, authors, and research collaborations. The number of UHI-related publications has continuously increased since 1991. Meteorology atmospheric sciences, environmental sciences, and construction building technology were the three most frequent subject categories. Building and Environment, International Journal of Climatology, and Theoretical and Applied Climatology were the three most popular publishing journals. The USA and China were the two leading countries in UHI research, contributing 49.56% of the total articles. Chinese Academy of Science, Arizona State University, and China Meteorological Administration published the most UHI articles. Weng QH and Santamouris M were the two most prolific authors. Author keywords were classified into four major groups: (1) research methods and indicators, e.g., remote sensing, field measurement, and models; (2) generation factors, e.g., impervious urban surfaces, urban geometry, waste heat, vegetation, and pollutants; (3) environmental effects, e.g., urban climate, heat wave, ecology, and pollution; and (4) mitigation and adaption strategies, e.g., roof technology cooling, reflective cooling, vegetation cooling, and urban geometry cooling. A comparative analysis of popular issues revealed that UHI determination (intensity, heat source, supporting techniques) remains the central topic, whereas UHI impacts and mitigation strategies are becoming the popular issues that will receive increasing scientific attention in the future. Modeling will continue to be the leading research method, and remote sensing will be used more widely. Additionally, a combination of remote sensing and field measurements with models is expected. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien."

Moreover, users actively engage in social media not only as a means to be informed about products and services but also to share their consumption experiences. Tourism in general, and sustainable tourism in particular, can benefit of the use of social media both as a marketing communication tool and as a venue for travellers to share their travel experiences through user-created content. That is, social media can satisfy both travellers and suppliers regarding sustainable tourism experiences. On the one hand, travellers can use social media not only to be informed about sustainable tourism destinations (pre-trip) but also to share on-trip and post-trip experiences. On the other hand, suppliers can use social media marketing to communicate their offer to travellers and other stakeholders. Nevertheless, despite an increasing academic effort over the last years to better understanding the use of social media in the area of tourism, the research in the specific area of sustainable tourism seems to be scarce. To fill this research gap, the main goal of this study is to gain a better knowledge on how travellers and suppliers are using social media in the context of sustainable tourism. To do so, a literature review including bibliometric and network analysis was undertaken in order to: i) identify the amount of research in this area, ii) identify publication trends of the analysed documents, iii) identify top research (most cited) and top researchers (most prolific authors) in the area, and iv) identify main networks of research. The main results suggest an increasing number of research on the topic with US-based researchers leading this research. Top keywords used by researchers include social media, sustainable tourism, and ecotourism. Two main co-citation-based networks were identified.

In this study, we have collected the scientific literature in the field of herb drug interactions published between 2011 to 2019 and analyzed it for the scientometric trends to understand the research direction in the last decade. We analyzed for the most prolific authors and their affiliations, top ten countries, funding agencies that sponsored the most publications and journals with most articles published in the field of herb drug interactions. We also identified three top articles of the field, two out of which made it to the list of top articles (based on citation count) of all time. We have identified upcoming research trend of network analysis and systems biology approach in the broad field of herbal medicines and application into the field of herb drug interactions. Our study demonstrated a dominant role of China and authors working in Chinese institutions (research output measured through analysis of publications, author contributions and grant fundings) in the field of herb drug interactions. As use of allopathy and herbal medicines together is on the rise worldwide, we predict that herb drug interactions will become an important concern in the future and precise regulatory guidelines must be developed worldwide as soon as possible. © 2020, Library Philosophy and Practice.

However, despite the popularity and extensive literature published on OP, very little is known about its evolution, current state, or findings of the field to date. Therefore, this study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of 426 publications on OP from 1976 through 2016. Results of this systematic review suggest that there have been considerable improvements in the scientific rigor and self-assessment being conducted in the discipline, although in total, few studies have used a strong empirical approach to develop new profiles. Even fewer evaluations of the effectiveness of OP have been conducted. The first summary of offender profiles proposed for major crimes in OP literature is also presented, with results indicating some recurrent themes in profiles, but wide variations in the number, name, and description of the profiles often found. A meta-analysis of case linkage analysis research indicates that this area is statistically sophisticated, and has yielded moderate to strong accuracy rates for linking crimes to a single offender. Finally, the first analysis of the most prolific authors, researchers, departments, and outlets for OP research, and the methods, approach, and most cited publications in OP are identified. Suggestions for future research on OP and the potential impact that this may have on policy and practice are also discussed. © 2018 American Psychological Association."

Analysis of scientific research in comorbidity and multimorbidity is limited in the biomedical literature. This study aimed to map global scientific research in comorbidity and multimorbidity to understand the maturity and growth of the area during the past decades. Methods and findings This was a cross-sectional analysis of the Web of Science. Searches were run from inception until November 8, 2016. We included research articles or reviews with no restrictions by language or publication date. Data abstraction was done by one researcher. A process of standardization was conducted by two researchers to unify different terms and grammatical variants and to remove typographical, transcription, and/or indexing errors. All potential discrepancies were resolved via discussion. Descriptive analyses were conducted (including the number of papers, citations, signatures, most prolific authors, countries, journals and keywords). Network analyses of collaborations between countries and co-words were presented. During the period 1970–2016, 85994 papers (64.0% in 2010–2016) were published in 3500 journals. There was wide diversity in the specialty of the journals, with psychiatry (16558 papers; 19.3%), surgery (9570 papers; 11.1%), clinical neurology (9275 papers; 10.8%), and general and internal medicine (7622 papers; 8.9%) the most common. PLOS One (1223 papers; 1.4%), the Journal of Affective Disorders (1154 papers; 1.3%), the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (727 papers; 0.8%), the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (634 papers; 0.7%) and Obesity Surgery (588 papers; 0.7%) published the largest number of papers. 168 countries were involved in the production of papers. The global productivity ranking was headed by the United States (37624 papers), followed by the United Kingdom (7355 papers), Germany (6899 papers) and Canada (5706 papers). Twenty authors who published 100 or more papers were identified; the most prolific authors were affiliated with Harvard Medical School, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, National Taiwan Normal University and China Medical University. The 50 most cited papers (“citation classics” with at least 1000 citations) were published in 20 journals, led by JAMA Psychiatry (11 papers) and JAMA (10 papers). The most cited papers provided contributions focusing on methodological aspects (e.g. Charlson Comorbidity Index, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, APACHE prognostic system), but also important studies on chronic diseases (e.g. epidemiology of mental disorders and its correlates by the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey, Fried’s frailty phenotype or the management of obesity). Conclusions Ours is the first analysis of global scientific research in comorbidity and multimorbidity. Scientific production in the field is increasing worldwide with research leadership of Western countries, most notably, the United States. © 2018 Catalá-López et al.

Design/methodology/approach: The study analyses five volumes of LR from the year 2007 to 2011 and employs the required bibliometric measures to analyze specific aspects of publishing trends of LR for the stated period. Findings: The study finds that single authored articles occupy the prominent position indicating the supremacy of solo research in LR. The degree of collaboration in the publications of this journal is found to be 0.36. It is evident that LR has accommodated over 22 citations per article during the publication phase from 2007 to 2011. In regard to country productivity, the UK leads the table, followed by the USA and Nigeria. However, Poland occupies the bottom position in the ranking. Hence, it is evident that the major chunks of contributions reflected in the publications of LR during the stated period are emanated from the UK and the USA. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on the publication patterns of LR over a period of five years. Patterns of research output in 275 publications are analyzed. Further studies can include a comparative study of LR with that of a contemporary journal in the field of library and information science (LIS). Practical implications: Teachers and research scholars of LIS can benefit from insights into the scholarly contributions of LR that has accommodated 312 authors representing 49 countries. Originality/value: The study yields some interesting findings of academic publishing in LR. It can help the readers of LR to understand the most striking contributions, highly cited journals, the most prolific authors, country productivity, and assorted parameters. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

To date, only a few evaluations of citation reports have been published in the field of pediatric surgery. Twenty-six years after its inception, Pediatric Surgery International (PSI) is a firmly established journal in pediatric surgery. The aim of this study was to identify, analyze and categorize the characteristics of the 100 most-cited articles published in PSI since its founding in 1986. Methods The Web of Knowledge SM, hosted by the Institute for Scientific Information, was searched with the all-database function for the 100 most-cited articles in PSI published from 1986 to the present. Each article was reviewed and the following parameters were recorded: number of citations, type of article, topic, year of publication, country of origin, institution and authorship. Results Between 1986 and 2012, 4,907 articles were published in PSI and 3,608 (73.53 %) of these were cited at least once. The 100 most-cited articles received a total of 3,309 citations with a mean of 33.09 (range 24-81). These articles were published between 1987 and 2007, with 73 articles published after 1997. Leading countries were USA (n=15), Australia (n=12), UK (n=9) and Ireland (n=9). Articles were categorized as followed: 92 original articles, 5 reviews and 3 case reports. 84 articles derived from clinical research and 16 derived from basic science. The most prolific authors were from 7 different institutions and published 37 articles, which received 1,213 (36.66 %) citations. Conclusion The 100 most-cited articles published in PSI were predominately original articles from English-speaking countries dealing with clinical topics. This analysis may be of value to the editorial board and authors by providing some insights into what types of manuscripts appear to be of interest to the reading audience of PSI. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

Although bibliometric studies have been done on this subject, these studies did not do an analysis of the contents of papers, the cooperation between countries, or of the names currently used to describe the condition. Furthermore, the number of publications since the last bibliometric study has doubled. Aim: This study was to examine the recent developments in the field, explore main topics/subject areas of the top 10 authors in this research field, and to compare diagnosis-defined data between International Classification of Diseases, 10 th edition (ICD-10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV). Materials and Methods: Using distinct search terms, the Web of Science database developed by the Thompson Reuters Institute of Scientific Information was scanned for relevant items published between 1900 and 2008. Results were analyzed using scientometric methods and density-equalizing calculations. Results: We found an important increase of publications on the subject over the last decade. Most published studies came from North America and Europe, while the countries cooperating with each other were comparable to other areas of medical research. Although there has been an increase in publications on BaD (m=3.3 publications per year in the last decade), the number of works using the term bipolar disorder (BD) was considerably higher (m=141.8 publications per year in the last decade). We found that the subject areas, genetics and pharmacology were focuses of research for the 10 most prolific authors, all of whom where psychiatrists. Conclusion: Research interest in BaD is rising. Reflecting the two main disease classification systems, DSM and ICD, both terms BD and BaD are used in research, with a preponderance of the former. The research of the most prolific authors engages genetic and pharmacological questions."

This article examines the work of two of the most prolific researchers in the field of sexual response and sexual orientation studies, J. Michael Bailey and Meredith L. Chivers. The article explores the researchers’ assumptions about pornography and sexuality through the rhetoric in their published papers and the aesthetics and content of the specific audio-visual stimuli they employ. Although the researchers employ pornography as a presumptively pre-cultural tool that produces objective scientific knowledge about sexual orientation, gender, and sex, their use of this sexually explicit audio-visual material in fact constructs the very categories it is then used to examine. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

Background: Bibliometric studies of single journals have been performed, but to the best of our knowledge, bibliometric analysis and bibliometric mapping have not yet been used to analyse the literature production of the Journal of Advanced Nursing. Design/Method: Using descriptive bibliometrics, we studied the dynamics and trend patterns of literature production and identified document types and the most prolific authors, papers, institutions and countries. Bibliometric mapping was used to visualize the content of published articles and determine the most prolific research terms and themes published in Journal of Advanced Nursing and their evolution through time. We were also interested in determining whether there were any ‘Sleeping Beauties’ among the articles published in the journal. Results: The study revealed a positive trend in literature production, although recently, the number of articles published in Journal of Advanced Nursing has slightly decreased. The most productive institutions are from the United Kingdom, which ranks in the highest place in terms of successful publishing in the journal. Thematic analysis showed that the most prolific themes corresponded to the basic aims and scope of the journal. Conclusion: Journal of Advanced Nursing contributes to advances in nursing research, practice and education as well as the quality of health care, teamwork and family care, with an emphasis on knowledge transfer and partnership between various healthcare professionals. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

We extracted a total of 10,062 articles and reviews from Web of Science (WoS) authored by the Turkish scientists between 2000 and 2011. We divided the data set into two 6-year periods (2000-2005 and 2006-2011). Almost three quarters (7,398) of all papers were published between 2006 and 2011. For each period, we compared the number of nanotechnology papers, the universities' output along with their levels of collaboration with one another, the diffusion and adoption of nanotechnology, the most prolific authors and the nanotechnology research topics studied most often by the Turkish researchers. We found that nanotechnology research and development (R&D) in Turkey is on the rise and its diffusion and adoption has increased tremendously in the second period. This is due primarily to the fact that the government identified nanotechnology as a strategic field a decade ago and decided to provide constant support for nanotechnology R&D. Overlay maps showed that nanotechnology R&D in Turkey concentrated primarily in Materials Sciences, followed by Chemistry, Physics, Clinical Medicine and Biomedical Sciences."

Patterns in professional publications provide insight into the profession's maturity and global status. To our knowledge, publication productivity in nuclear medicine technology has not been reported. A recent study on publication productivity in radiography and radiation therapy provided interesting insight; however, a sampling bias resulted in study flaws. Methods: The most productive medical radiation technologists were determined by collecting data from 7 key, international peer-reviewed journals for the medical radiation sciences over a 5-y period. A full list of the technologists' publications, for the 5-y period, was obtained using a PubMed and ResearchGate search, and the authors were analyzed. Results: In total, 165 medical radiation technologists were identified who had published 3 or more articles between 2009 and 2013. Of these authors, 55.2% (91/165) were radiographers, 35.2% (58/165) were radiation therapists, and 9.6% (16/165) were nuclear medicine technologists. Overall, the majority of the most prolific authors were academics (104/165; 63.0%). After we applied a correction factor (the productivity per member of the registered workforce), radiography had the fewest authors publishing, compared with the relative workflow sizes. Conclusion: Nuclear medicine technologists demonstrated a high degree of productivity both absolutely and relatively. Consequently, nuclear medicine technologists have a productive research culture and command a large footprint within and outside the key medical radiation science journals. © 2015 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc."

All 1,610 papers in the ISMIR proceedings written by 1,910 unique authors from 2000 to 2015 were collected and analyzed. Only 14.1% of all papers were led by female researchers. Temporal analysis shows that the percentage of lead female authors has not improved over the years, but more papers have appeared with female coauthors in very recent years. Topics and citation numbers are also analyzed and compared between female and male authors to identify research emphasis and to measure impact. The results show that the most prolific authors of both genders published similar numbers of ISMIR papers and the citation counts of lead authors in both genders had no significant difference. We also analyzed the collaboration patterns to discover whether gender is related to the number of collaborators.

There were 9124 articles and reviews, published in English between 1980 and January 2017. Although there were 103 reviews published on alginates, there has not been a scientometric study of alginates especially in the biomedical contexts, complementing many recent studies on algae and scientometric studies in other research fields in general. Therefore, this book chapter first presents a scientometric overview of the alginates research, as well as the research citing the original alginates research focusing on the most prolific authors, countries, publication years, institutions, journals, and subject categories. This book chapter then presents a scientometric overview of top 25 citation classics in alginates research, as well as the research citing these classical papers again focusing on the most prolific authors, countries, publication years, institutions, journals, and subject categories. This book chapter finally presents the concise information about the content of each classical paper based on the excerpts from the respective abstracts and full texts where necessary to inform the key stakeholders about the key contributions made by each classical paper and to direct these stakeholders to the source of these papers where necessary. The classical papers were presented fewer than two major topical categories: fundamentals of alginates and biomedical applications of alginates. In the first part, the papers were presented under the subheadings of the alginates in general, bacterial alginates, and alginate hydrogels. In these classical papers, the focus was on the exploration of the key structure-property relationships of alginates as natural biomaterials. In the second part, the classical papers on the biomedical applications of alginates were presented under the headings of alginates as scaffolds for tissue engineering, alginates as oral delivery matrices for protein drugs, microencapsulation of cells and other entities by alginates, and alginates for wound healing. The focus of the research presented in these classical papers was to increase efficiency of the drug delivery, tissue generation and microencapsulation of cells and other entities crucial for biomedical applications using modified alginates in hydrogel form. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The proportion of the Chinese population suffering from mental disorder has grown in parallel with the rapid economic development, as social stresses have increased. The aim of this study is to shed light on the status of collaborations in the Chinese psychiatry field, of which there is currently limited research. Methods: We sampled 16,224 publications (2003-2012) from 10 core psychiatry journals from Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang Database. We used various social network analysis (SNA) methods such as centrality analysis, and Core-Periphery analysis to study collaboration. We also used hierarchical clustering analysis in this study. Results: From 2003-2012, there were increasing collaborations at the level of authors, institutions and regions in the Chinese psychiatry field. Geographically, these collaborations were distributed unevenly. The 100 most prolific authors and institutions and 32 regions were used to construct the collaboration map, from which we detected the core author, institution and region. Collaborative behavior was affected by economic development. Conclusion: We should encourage collaborative behavior in the Chinese psychiatry field, as this facilitates knowledge distribution, resource sharing and information acquisition. Collaboration has also helped the field narrow its current research focus, providing further evidence to inform policymakers to fund research in order to tackle the increase in mental disorder facing modern China. © 2016 Wu and Jin."

However, there has not been an extensive scientometric evaluation of the institutional research carried out by the universities in the Inner Anatolian Region of Turkey, to examine the development of the research over time. Hence, the purpose of this study was to carry out a scientometric evaluation of the research performed by these universities using three indices in a series of four papers. In the third part of these serial papers, it was found that the placement of incorrect names for the university name in the affiliation section of the abstract pages of the papers was a serious problem especially for the institutions with more than two words in their names resulting in the lack of visibility in the institutional rankings. The preferred name format for the name of the institutions was ""x univ"" rather than ""univ x"". There were 79,150 articles and reviews published by these universities and 91.6% of these papers were indexed by the SCIE as they were related to Natural and Applied Sciences. Only 7.2% and 1.2% of these papers were indexed by SSCI and A&HCI, respectively as they were concerned with Social Sciences and Arts & Humanities. There was a strong Social Sciences and Arts & Humanities deficit in the research output of Inner Anatolian Universities. These results were in line with the results relating to the research productivity of Turkish Universities at a national scale. ""Turker L"" was the most prolific author and the most prolific authors were from Baskent University (2), Erciyes University (2), Hacettepe University (2), Orta Dogu Technical University (2), Bilkent University (1), and Anadolu University (1). The most prolific authors were from the natural sciences departments (Physics-3, Chemistry-4) and from the Health Sciences departments (Surgery-1, Obstetrics-1, Pharmacy-1). It is thus notable that there were not any most prolific authors from Social Sciences as well as Humanities and Arts. It was found that the top most prolific institution in terms of the number of publications was Hacettepe University and the SSCI and A&HCI-related subject dominance was pronounced for the Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University. Overall, in terms of the research productivity, the top university was Hacettepe University with a five-year H-index of 44, closely followed by the Orta Dogu Technical University and Ankara University with H-index of 43 each. The results found in the third part suggest that there was a close structure-research performance relationships for these universities hinting the strong effect of the formal and informal rules adapted by these universities on their respective research productivity following North's new institutional theoretical framework. © Sila Science.

Over the years, the testing techniques, strategies, and criteria utilized by researchers went through technical developments due to the improvement of technologies and programming languages. Software testing designers, known as testers, currently have several resources to increase their confidence in the software under test correctness. All of these software testing resources are supposed to include a mechanism to decide whether a particular execution is considered a failure or not. In software testing environments, this decision is the responsibility of the test oracle. Despite the evolution and adaptation of testing techniques over more than 30 years, test oracles remain a particular and relevant issue. In this chapter, using literary evidence from a pool of about 300 studies directly related to test oracles, we present a classification of test oracles based on a taxonomy that considers their source of information and notations. Based on this classification, we perform a quantitative analysis to highlight the shifts in (evolution of) research on test oracles. Exploring geographical and quantitative information, we analyzed the maturity of this field using coauthorship networks among studies published between 1978 and 2013. Further, we determine the most prolific authors and their countries, main conferences and journals, supporting tools, and academic efforts and use a comparative analysis between academia and industry. Finally, from these analyses, we draw an analytic reflection about contemporary test oracle approaches and a criticism about oracle trends. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

The numbers of articles, citations, authors, institutions, and journals were analyzed and subjected to quantitative and qualitative comparisons. The number of published orthopedics articles increased between 2000 and 2011. Articles published by authors from the United States always ranked first in number, although the United States' share is decreasing in the world literature. Authors from the United States published the most-cited articles and the most articles in journals with top-10 impact factors; moreover, the United States also had the greatest share of experts and highly ranked institutions. The United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan were always within the world's top 4 in terms of numbers of articles and citations. The shares of Germany, South Korea, and China among total orthopedics articles increased, especially that of China. In 2011, China ranked the fifth in the world, with its world share increasing from 0.64% in 2000 to 5.05% in 2011.

Design: This exploratory study of the literature used several bibliometric research methods to describe patterns and identify highly represented articles, authors, institutions, and journals. Setting: The Library and Information Science Abstracts database. Subjects: 436 articles from 118 journals. Methods: Research articles and review papers published through December 31, 2012, were identified by searching Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA). Citation data for the 436 articles selected was gathered from LISA and Scopus. Main Results: The 436 articles from 118 journals had publication dates from 2001 through 2012, originated from 68 countries in 19 languages, and had authors affiliated with 159 institutions. The greatest number of institutional repository articles were published in 2011 while year-to-year growth was greatest from 2005-2006. Most highly represented were the United States and the United Kingdom, followed by India, Australia, and Spain. Twenty publishers were responsible for nearly half of the selected articles. The top four journals included OCLC Systems & Services, D-Lib Magazine, Serials Review, and Library Hi Tech. D-Lib Magazine alone published seven of the top 20 most cited articles. While most articles were written by a single author, the majority of the multiple author articles came from developed countries. Citation analysis reveals that the 436 articles were cited 2,071 times, for an average of 4.8 citations per article. However, 147 articles received no citations. The five most prolific authors were Elizabeth Yakel, Kim Jihyun, Karen Markey, Jingfeng Xia, and Sarika Sawant. Conclusion: The author concludes that developing countries lag behind in establishing and publishing on institutional repositories and suggests that more authors will deposit in IR in the future. A proposed role for LIS professionals is to communicate the objectives, values, and principles behind institutional repositories. © 2015."

The issue of co-authorships became a dominant feature of the inquiry. The most common areas were corporate finance and investment management, and this reflects the large amount of data supplied by publicly traded companies, although it means that others were neglected. The production of literature is concentrated in the hands of a few people in the South-East of the country and is lower than what was predicted by the bibliometric theory. A large majority of authors only published one article and only 5% published five or more. The international articles of the most prolific authors are largely found in ""low impact"" periodicals. The lack of innovation, either of a theoretical or methodological kind, prevents international publications from having a significant effect.

Using this database, a quantitative analysis was carried out using the following indicators: (i) production, which evaluates both the quantity and characteristics of these publications, (ii) impact, which measures the repercussion of this production and (iii) relational, which evaluates citation, co-citation and co-authorship networks. The results showed a growing trend in the number of publications, especially in the last two decades. Additionally, this analysis revealed that the distribution of these publications was significantly concentrated in terms of the most cited documents, the most prolific authors and the institutions which sponsored these publications. Furthermore, a network analysis showed a reduced density in the citation and co-authorship networks, as well as isolated debates on certain themes. © 2015 National Association of Postgraduate Centers in Economics, ANPEC"

We include the number of authors who have published in the journals but who may not be considered prolific based on our classification; this data is important and especially critical for IS departments that set research standards. Identifying and ranking authors in the IS discipline is interesting for several reasons. While some may be curious to see how they perform compared to these researchers, a more beneficial application of the findings in this paper pertains to establishing realistic promotion and tenure standards. Although 11,204 authors published in the 11 high-impact journals, 7,734 (69%) of those authors published only once in these journals in the 1977-2014 period. This fact is essential for any IS department that sets promotion and tenure guidelines. Using our findings will help colleges and IS departments establish reasonable and attainable promotion and tenure standards based on the actual performance of others in the discipline. © 2017 by the Association for Information Systems."

The aim of this study was to identify the 100 most-cited articles focused on ultrasound (US) imaging and to analyze the characteristics of these articles. Methods We determined the 100 most-cited articles on US imaging via the Web of Science database, using the search term. The following parameters were used to analyze the characteristics of the 100 most-cited articles: publication year, journal, journal impact factor, number of citations and annual citations, authors, department, institution, country, type of article, and topic. Results The number of citations for the 100 most-cited articles ranged from 1849 to 341 (median: 442.0) and the number of annual citations ranged from 108.0 to 8.1 (median: 22.1). The majority of articles were published in 1990-1999 (39%), published in radiology journals (20%), originated in the United States (45%), were clinical observation studies (67%), and dealt with the vessels (35%). The Department of Internal Medicine at the University of California and the Research Institute of Public Health at the University of Kuopio (n=4 each) were the leading institutions and Salonen JT and Salonen R (n=4 each) were the most prolific authors.

The GMF-related research maintains stable growth with established research teams and sufficient funds in the recent years. GMF-related research is a young field with a newly established intellectual base, and widely recognized as bio-science study. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, European Food Research and Technology, Food and Chemical Toxicology were the most active journals in the field. H. Akiyama, R. Teshima, A. Hino and A. Cifuentes were the most prolific authors in GMF-related research. For countries, both the pro-GMF and anti-GMF countries have pushed relevant research, including USA, EU, and Japan. Considering the GMF as national non-traditional security issue, inter-institute collaborations were more visible than that of international collaborations. Through keyword analysis, we found that the trendy of GMF-related research has been shifted from a pure technological perspective to a combination of technology, food safety and public acceptance. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."

Together, the top 50 authors account for nearly 8 % of the LIS literature. Moreover, the most productive LIS faculty are concentrated in relatively few universities. Faculty in the natural sciences and LIS are more likely to be found among the top 50 authors than their overall contributions would suggest, while librarians, computer scientists and non-academic authors are underrepresented. Top authors are especially likely to publish in the Journal of Informetrics and Scientometrics. Among American LIS faculty, the list of the most prolific authors has changed substantially over time.

Bibliometric analysis was used to identify the pattern of publication, relative growth rate, authorship pattern, collaborative measures, author's productivity, most prolific authors, and most prolific journals. A total of 3,585 published documents were retrieved from Palestine. A steady increase was observed after 2001. The h-index of the retrieved documents was 57. Fifty-three (1.48%) documents were published in Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal, whereas 52 (1.45%) and 49 (1.37%) documents were published in Journal of Dispersion Science and Technology and Asian Journal of Chemistry, respectively. Half of the top 20 journals in which Palestinian researchers had published their articles were un-indexed in Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) web of knowledge. The highest number of documents published by a Palestinian researcher was 79. The main subject area of published documents from Palestine was medicine (717; 20.00%), followed by chemistry (551, 15.37%), and engineering (530, 14.78%). The top countries involved in research collaboration with Palestine were the United States (422, 11.70%), followed by Germany (381; 10.71%), and the United Kingdom (208; 5.83%). There was a significant correlation between number of collaborating countries with Palestine in one hand, and quantity and quality of research activity in Palestine on the other hand. The number of collaborating countries with Palestine increased almost ten-fold from 1995 to 2012. Research output from Palestine showed steady growth since the Oslo peace accords. Research output was high from certain scientific disciplines while was lagging from others.

The purpose of this research was to describe and characterize the global collaborative patterns in meta-analyses of randomized trials published in high impact factor medical journals over the past three decades.Methods: This was a cross-sectional, social network analysis. We searched PubMed for relevant meta-analyses of randomized trials published up to December 2012. We selected meta-analyses (including at least randomized trials as primary evidence source) published in the top seven high impact factor general medical journals (according to Journal Citation Reports 2011): The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, the BMJ, JAMA, Annals of Internal Medicine, Archives of Internal Medicine (now renamed JAMA Internal Medicine), and PLoS Medicine. Opinion articles, conceptual papers, narrative reviews, reviews without meta-analysis, reviews of reviews, and other study designs were excluded.Results: Overall, we included 736 meta-analyses, in which 3,178 authors, 891 institutions, and 51 countries participated. The BMJ was the journal that published the greatest number of articles (39%), followed by The Lancet (18%), JAMA (15%) and the Archives of Internal Medicine (15%). The USA, the UK, and Canada headed the absolute global productivity ranking in number of papers. The 64 authors and the 39 institutions with the highest publication rates were identified. We also found 82 clusters of authors (one group with 55 members and one group with 54 members) and 19 clusters of institutions (one major group with 76 members). The most prolific authors were mainly affiliated with the University of Oxford (UK), McMaster University (Canada), and the University of Bern (Switzerland).Conclusions: Our analysis identified networks of authors, institutions and countries publishing meta-analyses of randomized trials in high impact medical journals.

The present study reports the discovery pattern and taxonomic efforts for this group based on global species and a literature dataset. In addition, three asymptotic models (Logistic, Gompertz, and Extreme Value) based on a discovery curve were used to predict the species number of scale insects. Our results showed that the species description rate has been changing over time, with certain peaks and valleys in the past 250 years. The mean number of species described per year was 30, with the highest number of 195 described species in 1985. The increasing number of authors and the almost constant proportion of species described by 10% most prolific authors since the 1900s suggested that taxonomic effort has been increasing over time. The Gompertz model with lowest AIC value suggested that there are about 10,450 species of scale insects on Earth, nearly 30% of which remain to be described.

Design/methodology/approach - The archival research method is applied, which analyses existing data (in this case the articles published in the South African (SA) accounting research journals) to come to research conclusions. The research method used to analyse the related articles in the SA accounting research journals is based on various international studies. The following dimensions are assessed: authorship; research field; the nature of the research; and research methods. Authorship is classified by institution, and the top seven authors by relative contribution are also identified. Both empirical and theoretical work are classified separately in different research methods. Findings - These different dimensions provide a broad-based review of the current profile of accounting research in South Africa. Research limitations/implications - Other refereed academic articles in the field of accounting have been published in non-accounting specific SAPSE-approved journals. These articles are also excluded from the scope of this research since the journals in which they are published have not been established by accounting academics specifically. Practical implications - The motivation for doing this research is to identify the current profile of accounting research in South Africa that could be used as a basis for future research-related development. Originality/value - Knowledge of the profile of accounting research in South Africa could provide opportunities for scholars to expand identified research areas and explore methods that are currently under-developed in the South African accountancy research field.

The University had registered the average citation impact per paper of 7.01 per cent and 6 publications received 51 to 100 citations. Among the Indian universities, University stood at 23rd rank in term of publications output (652) and h-index (29), 16th rank in average citation per paper (7.01 per cent) and 18th rank in share of high cited papers (1 per cent) and 19th rank in terms of international collaborative papers (27.45 per cent) during 2006-15. Around 68.71 per cent publications of the University in physics and astronomy were in national collaboration between GNDU and several other Indian organisations. The study clearly indicates that journals are the most preferred form of publication to communicate research works by the researchers. © 2017, DESIDOC."

The objective of this study was to do a bibliometric assessment of research output, which describes the growth, contribution, and impact of research carried out by the faculty members, researchers, or students of ANNU in the past 35 years. The data used for this study were retrieved from Scopus database. Bibliometric analysis was used to identify the pattern of publication, relative growth rate, authorship pattern, collaborative measures, author’s productivity, most prolific authors, and most prolific journals. A total of 791 published documents were retrieved for ANNU. Seventeen documents (2.1%) were published in Acta Crystallographica Section E Structure Reports Online, whereas 16 (2.0%) were published in Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part A: Environmental Science and Engineering, and 10 (1.3%) were published in International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics. Six hundred one (76%) documents were published in journals listed in Web of Knowledge. The total number of citations for documents published from ANNU, at the time of data analysis (November 19, 2013), was 4,553, with an average of 5.8 citations per document. The study identified 384 (25.8%) documents with 59 countries as ANNU–foreign collaborators. Research output from ANNU showed steady growth over the past 35 years. Research output was high from certain scientific disciplines, whereas was lagging from others. Future emphasis on joint research, international collaboration, and publishing in indexed journals is needed. © The Author(s) 2014."

Design: Bibliographic analysis of trial publications. Data sources and review methods We searched PubMed for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) relating to glucose lowering drugs published between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2013. From these publications we identified the 110 most prolific authors using PubReMiner. The 991 RCTs they published were examined for various characteristics such as author number, commercial sponsorship, company authorship, conflicts of interest, etc. The track record of the top 11 authors was studied in more detail. Main outco me measure: Proportion of articles published by the top 110 and the top 11 authors. Results: 3782 articles from 13 592 authors were identified. The top 110 authors were named in 1227 (32.4%) of all articles, and the top 11 authors in 397 (10.5%) of all articles. The top 110 authors published 991 RCTs for a median of 20 (range 4-77) RCTs per author; the top 11 published 354 RCTs for a median of 42 (36-77) RCTs per author. Of the 110 top authors, 48 were employed by a pharmaceutical company. Of the 991 RCTs, 906 were commercially sponsored. Of 704 articles that could be assessed for conflicts of interest, only 42 (6%) were considered fully independent. Medical writing assistance was acknowledged in 439 (44.3%) of 991 RCTs. Conclusion: The past two decades have seen an explosive increase in the number of published clinical trials regarding glucose lowering treatment. Some authors have made a disproportionate contribution to the therapeutic evidence base; one third of the RCT evidence base on glucose lowering drug treatment for diabetes was generated by less than 1% of authors. Of these, 44% were company employees and 56% were academics who work closely with the pharmaceutical companies. ©BMJ Publishing Group Ltd 2015."

Design/methodology/approach – The authors follow Chan et al. (2011) to use their 22 finance journals. For accounting journals, the paper includes a set of 24 accounting journals that were used in a global accounting ranking study by Chan et al. (2007). The paper uses the number of coauthors (n) and coaffiliations (M) to derive the weighted articles as the measurement metric. Findings – In general, the research output in terms of weighted articles steadily increases during the 20-year period. The University of Manchester, London School of Economics, and London Business School are the top-three HEIs using 44 accounting and finance journals for the full sample. The authors also find that it is a challenge to publish multiple articles. If an author is able to manage five total appearances, he/she is in the top 16 percent among the 1,447 UK authors. Furthermore, the paper finds that many highly productive authors are able to move to different jobs during the 20-year period. Research limitations/implications – The assessment of research productivity is, unavoidably, based on a set of selected accounting and finance journals. Hence, no matter what journal screening criteria the paper uses, there is always a subjective element in the process. If other journals or more/less journals were to be included in a similar study, different results may emerge. As a way to extend the value of the research, it would be interesting to obtain broader institutional knowledge, such as the tenure requirements of HEIs in UK, and information on the institutions where faculty members obtained their doctoral degrees, so that the authors can better evaluate the research productivity among accounting and finance community in the UK. Originality/value – The paper conducts an assessment of the research productivity of accounting and finance community in UK HEIs during 1991-2010 using 44 high-quality accounting and finance journals. The study fills the gap of the extant literature to compliment the assessment of the UK accounting and finance departments in RAEs. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Aim and setting: A review of accounting research in internationalising journals in the South African region that publish accounting research. Methods: The characteristics of accounting articles were analysed. Five journals were analysed, including the four internationalising journals, Investment Analysts Journal, Meditari Accountancy Research, South African Journal of Business Management, and South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences and one local journal, South African Journal of Accounting Research (SAJAR). Results: The findings of this study will be of interest to journal editors, authors who would like their research to make an impact and be cited, as well as university research administrators and government higher education policy-makers. Conclusion: The analyses show that many of the highly cited articles have been published recently, boding well for the citation statistics of these journals in future and indicating some success in their efforts to internationalise. The citations of SAJAR lag behind the citations of the internationalising journals. Each journal publishes articles that cover different subject area(s). Within accounting research, accounting education and social and environmental accounting are popular areas of research, whereas taxation; the public sector; and management accounting are not well represented among published articles during 2015-2016 in these five journals. About half of all accounting articles claim their insights will contribute to the accounting literature, with much smaller percentages claiming to contribute to management, policy-making and practice. The most prolific authors and most prominent universities to some extent follow the most popular subject areas, with a social and environmental researcher, Warren Maroun, featuring strongly, and his university, the University of the Witwatersrand, being prominent. Large proportions of authors of 2015-2016 articles are from outside of Africa, speaking to the success of the internationalisation efforts of the internationalising journals, whereas SAJAR mostly publishes articles by African authors. © 2017.

Based on a review of the literature, the aim of this paper is to provide a current overview of Reading Research, starting from the study of new factors that have influenced the growth of this field. To this end, a bibliometric analysis was carried out, focusing on four main points: areas of knowledge; the most prolific authors; the contrast between Reading Research and Digital Reading Research; and the main topic areas being studied. The methodology used involves an extensive collection of data originating from different sources, data analyses, the calculation of efficiency rates and the solutions used to the address disparity in the amount and type of data found. This study confirms that the onset of the use of technological devices for reading stimulated the growth of Reading Research. Since 2009, when the use of the Kindle e-reader (Amazon) stabilized, preceding the launch of the iPad tablet (Apple) in 2010, digital reading played an important role in Reading Research, attracting new topics and research prospects."

Methods All articles published in the 2011 issues of all journals included in the Journal Citation Reports subject category Ophthalmology were inspected to expose those papers related to the contact lens field. Information regarding source journal was obtained and authorship details were recorded to determine the top most prolific authors, institutions and countries. A comprehensive list of key words was compiled to generate a two-dimensional term map in which the frequency of occurrence of a particular term is defined by label size and the distance between two terms is an indication of the relatedness of these terms, based on their co-occurrences within groups of key words. Clusters of related terms were also identified. Results Visual examination of all articles uncovered a total of 156 papers, published in 28 different journals. Contact Lens & Anterior Eye, Eye & Contact Lens and Optometry and Vision Science had 27 articles each. The most prolific authors and institutions revealed the predominance of countries with long research tradition in the contact lens field. Ten different word clusters or areas of interest were identified, including both traditional, yet unresolved issues (e.g., comfort or dry eye), and the latest research efforts (e.g., myopia control).

The aim was to identify key trends in the evolution of MIP. Four areas were addressed, including an analysis of the nature of authorship, identification and ranking of the most prolific authors, recognition of the most influential articles based on number of citations, and an exploration of the research themes within the published articles. During the 21 years a total of 952 papers appeared in the journal and out of these, 856 were research articles and thereby included in the content analysis. A coding protocol was developed, covering author demographics, citations and research themes. Findings show a trend going from single-authored articles towards increased collaboration both within and across countries, and across institutions. The 24 most productive authors counted for 20.2 per cent of the analysed articles, and most of them were from the UK. The 856 articles included in the analysis received 9.368 citations. The five most prevalent research topics during the 21-year period as a whole were: marketing strategy, consumer behaviour, research measurement and metrics, global/export marketing, and customer relationship management. Differences with respect to the research topics were found over the time period. This analysis identifies key trends in the evolution of MIP.

Our findings show that the set of authors and schools of the most prolific authors in international accounting in the U.S. are not the same as the set of the most prolific authors and schools of AOS. Neither the international accounting authors nor their academic affiliations were dominated by U.S. or U.K. academic institutions. The authors in international accounting were promoted within and between schools and many were full professors with professorships. The dominant research methods used and topics researched in AOS were different from those of U.S. journals. Young faculty should develop their career objective and align their employment and publication goals accordingly because they have a broad selection of mentors, universities and journals for which to target their research. Aligning research interests with academic environment choices should maximize an international accounting faculty's publication productivity and academic rank.

Over the years many important papers spanning the entire field of chemical toxicology have appeared in JAT. One way to assess the usefulness of these papers is by looking at the number of times they subsequently become cited in the reference lists of papers published in other peer-reviewed journals including JAT itself (self-citations). The Thomson Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, has produced a citation database containing all JAT articles published between 1981 through 2003 (N = 2254). This database was used to gather information about the most prolific authors of articles appearing in JAT, the most highly cited articles, the inter-relationships between co-authors, and the countries where the work originated. The person listed most frequently as an author was E.J. Cone, who authored or co-authored 69 papers that attracted a total of 1432 citations, giving a citation impact of 20.76. However, the most highly cited article in JAT was a solo-author work from 1981 by M.E. Jolley describing a fluorescence polarization immunoassay for the analysis of therapeutic drugs in plasma, which was cited 184 times. Working and writing in teams can boost the output of scientific articles as exemplified by the Institut de Médecine Légale in Strasbourg with P. Kintz as the driving force. Kintz and his associates produced the most collaborative work published in JAT. Citation analysis is being increasingly used to evaluate the importance of scientific articles and the journals where these works are published (e.g., impact factors). This article has identified JAT's scientific elite as evidenced by the most prolific authors and the most highly cited papers."

A search was made in Medline® and Scopus® (Elsevier) to compare the publication by topics and the citation. Results: 303 articles were published in Infectio, of which 47.19% were original articles. We found 25 authors with three or more original articles, with 2 large producers and 457 transients for a rate of 85.58% of transience. Intra-institutional collaboration was 44.06%. The most frequent topics in original articles were microbial drug resistance, HIV, toxoplasma and tuberculosis. The impact factor varied between 0.18 and 0.59. The topics most cited were neutropenia and HIV. Conclusion: The production of original articles was high. The groups identified are composed of the most prolific authors. Bibliometric indicators of productivity and collaboration were similar to those of international biomedical journals.

Based on the findings, it was concluded that the KM/IC discipline represents a very young, attractive academic field that welcomes contributions from a variety of academics and practitioners. In their paper acceptance decisions, KM/IC journal editors are not biased towards a small group of highly productive researchers, which is a positive sign that the field has been progressing in the right direction. The discipline is driven more by academics than by practitioners, and the distribution of articles is more concentrated among a few academic but not practitioner institutions.

The United Kingdom's General Practice Research Database (GPRD) is one of the few electronic health databases publicly available to academic researchers. This study analyzed studies that used GPRD to demonstrate the scientific production and academic impact by a single public health database. Methodology and Findings: A total of 749 studies published between 1995 and 2009 with 'General Practice Research Database' as their topics, defined as GPRD studies, were extracted from Web of Science. By the end of 2009, the GPRD had attracted 1251 authors from 22 countries and been used extensively in 749 studies published in 193 journals across 58 study fields. Each GPRD study was cited 2.7 times by successive studies. Moreover, the total number of GPRD studies increased rapidly, and it is expected to reach 1500 by 2015, twice the number accumulated till the end of 2009. Since 17 of the most prolific authors (1.4% of all authors) contributed nearly half (47.9%) of GPRD studies, success in conducting GPRD studies may accumulate. The GPRD was used mainly in, but not limited to, the three study fields of ""Pharmacology and Pharmacy"", ""General and Internal Medicine"", and ""Public, Environmental and Occupational Health"". The UK and United States were the two most active regions of GPRD studies. One-third of GRPD studies were internationally co-authored. Conclusions: A public electronic health database such as the GPRD will promote scientific production in many ways. Data owners of electronic health databases at a national level should consider how to reduce access barriers and to make data more available for research. © 2011 Chen et al."

[1] has had the highest impact on the literature with 637 citations and 106.2 citations per year. Both the research output and the citations have increased spectacularly after 2005, making a respective peak in 2010. The results of this first ever scientometric study of its kind for the biohydrogen research show that the scientometric analysis has a great potential to gain valuable insights into the evolution of the high-profile research on the biohydrogen, complementing other research techniques such as literature reviews, meta-analyses, and content analyses as well as the emerging research on other types of renewable energies. © Sila Science."

The present review recovers journal articles included in the database PsycINFO and provides a descriptive analysis of the production over a century. An analysis of contents was developed using three different criteria: reviewing articles written by the most prolific authors; using the major descriptors assigned by PsycINFO to these publications; and classificating ad hoc articles by several judges. Comparing the periods 1947-57 and 1997-2007 we confirmed the progression from theoretical approaches to empirical studies as well as the change in focus from social class to contexts of intervention (school, family and community). However, those outcomes showed clearly the need to develop new initiatives which allow the classification of the enormous amount of information related to JD issued each year. We discuss the suitability of the term JD in the Spanish social and legal context, proposing as a possible substitute Menor Infractor (Young Offender). © The European Journal of Psychology Applied to Legal Context."

In this context, a number of interesting papers on the ""Erdos Number"", which gives the shortest path (geodesic distance) between an author and the well-known Hungarian mathematician Erdos in a co-authorship network, have been published recently. This paper develops new methods concerning the position of highly productive authors in the network. Thus a relationship of distribution of these authors among the clusters in the co-authorship network could be proved to be dependent upon the size of the clusters. Highly productive authors have, on average, low geodesic distances and thus shorter length of paths to all the other authors of a specialism compared to low productive authors, whereas the influencing possibility of highly productive scientists gets distributed amongst others in the development of the specialism. A theory on the stratification in science with respect to the over random similarity of scientists collaborating with one another, previously covered with other empirical methods, could also be confirmed by the application of geodesic distances. The paper proposes that the newly developed methodology may also be applied to visible networks in future studies on the Web. Further investigation is warranted into whether co-authorship and web networks have similar structures with regards to author productivity and geodesic distances."

The journals that published the most articles on cross-cultural and ethnic minority issues from 1993 to 1999 and the most prolific authors on these issues were identified by PsycINFO. Cross-cultural research is cross-national, whereas ethnic minority research involves groups of color within the United States. The citation impact of these journals and authors was determined from the 1997 Social Sciences Citation Index. The results suggest that there is very limited overlap between the literatures in cross-cultural and ethnic minority psychology, Most of the research in these areas is published in specialty journals, and there is a paucity of this research in prestigious journals. Perceived or actual barriers to publication in prestigious journals may cause some to seek specialty journals as outlets for research on cultural diversity. The top scholars in cross-cultural psychology are primarily men of European ancestry, whereas most of the top scholars in ethnic minority psychology are ethnic minority men and women. Strategies to increase the prominence of cultural diversity in the psychology literature include combining cross-cultural and ethnic minority psychology, increasing the number of editorial board members of prestigious journals having expertise in cultural diversity, and increasing the quality of specially journals. Psychology will remain ill-equzipped to face the challenges of the new millennium without increased attention to cultural diversity."

Past research has demonstrated the breadth and depth of biblometric tools by investigating a variety of research communities (White and Griffith 1981; Tsay 1989; McCain 1991; Borgman and Rice 1992; White and McCain 1998; Smiraglia 2006, 2009, Moore 2007; Jank 2010). Using the published literature produced in SI from 1997 through 2009, allowed visualization of domain-coherence in SI. Concepts that were utilized by which to measure domain coherence include the number of ideas espoused (Collins 1998, 42), scholarly productivity (Crane 1972), and the number of scholars participating (Price 1986; Collins 1998). In this lightning paper based on a recent dissertation (Hoeffner 2012) we will present a visualization based on the analysis of social informatics' literature, showing growth in publication productivity, evidence of intellectually and socially connected scholars, reliance on scholars from within the fields of information science, and computer science, and two or three topical areas of interest that pertained to communication and aspects of computer mediation, as well as policy and access. Discourse among scholars was evident, and although the Journal of the American Society for Information Science & Technology overwhelming published the largest number of SI work, there was representation in a few key journals. Author co-citation patterns revealed a core group of scholars commonly cited together, and an investigation of self-citation practices revealed slightly less evidence among SI's most prolific authors than in science overall. Recently, Smiraglia (2012) defined a domain as ""a domain is a group with an ontological base that reveals an underlying teleology, a set of common hypotheses, epistemological consensus on methodological approaches, and social semantics."" Our visualization demonstrates continued coherence of SI as a domain."

Searching through the keywords “entrepreneurship” and “intrapreneurship,” the database offered 45,538 results; searching “digital era and digitalisation” 340,030 results; and combining the mentioned keywords 975 results; finally, after subsequent refinements, the dataset provided 141 articles. The selected articles were analysed to understand the evolution of this research field in the last 30 years, the main countries/regions sensitive on the theme, the journals most interested in published studies on the topic, and the most prolific authors. The content was analysed in-depth to identify methods used, main theories, and common themes.

Concurrently, diverse research groups have investigated the disease through various methodologies, enhancing our scientific knowledge base. This study was designed to collate and analyze the literature on peanut smut comprehensively, presenting a detailed scientometric analysis that traces the trajectory of research from the beginning to the current state. To achieve this goal, bibliographic data about the disease was compiled, and metrics were calculated. The analysis revealed that a small proportion of the scientific output was published in peer-reviewed journals, with epidemiology and breeding being the predominant topics. Collaborative efforts played a pivotal role in advancing the study of this disease. The study also pinpointed the most prolific researchers, participating institutions, and the influence of the published work, alongside other trends. However, despite notable progress in peanut smut research, this progress is insufficiently reflected in peer-reviewed literature, posing a challenge for researchers within this domain. Continued studies are vital for the integrated management of peanut smut, to mitigate further yield losses and prevent the pathogen's spread into new production regions. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Sociedade Brasileira de Fitopatologia."

OBJECTIVE: To explore the global trend and development prospects of clinical rehabilitation-related blood flow restriction training application, identify research gaps, and propose future research directions. METHODS: Web of Science, PubMed, and Elsevier were searched for literature related to clinical rehabilitation using blood flow restriction training published from 2001 to 2022. A total of 515 articles were included for further review. Bibliometrics, exploratory factor analysis and cluster analysis were used to reveal the emerging research fields and topics. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: First of all, the overall research trend of the number of published articles shows a steady rise. The United States is the main research area in this field, and universities contribute the most to journals. Secondly, a core group of authors, led by Loenneke JP, Abe T and Dankel SJ, has been formed, with less collaboration among highly productive authors. Finally, research on blood flow restriction training focuses on skeletal muscle rehabilitation, cognitive functional activity, and chronic disease rehabilitation in clinical rehabilitation, with particular attention to the application of blood flow restriction in the recovery of symptoms such as muscle atrophy, knee pain, and joint effusion after anterior cruciate reconstruction surgery. Theoretical research on low-pressure blood flow restriction that is effective in relieving musculoskeletal symptoms has been hot in recent years, which can systematically guide the musculoskeletal rehabilitation in clinical practice. In the future, clinicians will extend follow-up periods, register larger and more diverse sample sizes, and use randomization techniques to determine appropriate prescribing indications for rehabilitating patients, ensure clinical safety, and quantitatively analyze and develop rehabilitation protocols with the maximum effect at the minimum effective dose for different clinical populations. © 2024, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

When an article is cited, the first author often gets the primary or even full credit, even if the citing paper cites the method part of the article, which is mainly contributed by the second author. This study proposes a context-based author credit (CAC) model to allocate individual credit to coauthors in a multi-authored paper. In the proposed model, coauthor's credit is conceptualized as a directed and weighted connection between citations and contributor roles, where the relationship was decided by citation context. Citation strength was used in the proposed model instead of the number of citing papers which can make the credit of research more precise. The proposed approach can complement existing measures of author credit analysis based on author signature order. In our experiments, the model was validated by fitting to empirical data, a group of highly productive authors’ articles and their citing papers, from PLOS Medicine. The results show that CAC model outperforms prior alternatives such as normal, fractional, harmonic counting and author contribution solely based on contribution list in terms of reflecting the specific performance of coauthors. Besides, the CAC model has a certain sensitivity to the contributions of lower-ranked authors, breaking through the restriction of the author's signature order. This paper also provides the new application of this model in author academic evaluation. © 2022"

Considering other factors affecting the research results, we also set up control variables (the number of co-authors, proportion of high-level authors and ratio of highly productive authors). We used the Scopus database as the data source and collected all articles published in the dental field in 2018 as data. We used multiple linear regression analyses to examine the impact of co-authors’ variety on the article impact. The results demonstrate that the relationship between scientific collaboration variety and article impact is complicated, which depends on the type of variety of the cooperative scientist.

First, we chart the citation per article trend of Colombia’s most prolific researchers before and after receiving the special mention and the AAEP. We then compare the special mention group with those awarded the AAEP, using a composite citation indicator of six scientific impact and productivity indices to estimate (1) bulk impact (number of citations and h index) and (2) authorship order adjusted impact (Schreiber hm index; total citations for articles of which the scientist is the single author; total citations for articles of which the scientist is the single or first author; and total citations for articles of which the scientist is the single, first, or last author). Results show that there is no overall halo effect in citation per article after receiving the special mention or the AAEP. Such recognition comes after an academically productive career marked by multiple citations per article peaks.

Notably, one of the pioneers and most prolific authors of such genre was Peter Kolosimo (pen name of Pier Domenico Colosimo, 1922-1984), who published, between the late 1950s and the early 1980s, multiple books touching upon the subject that were translated into dozens of languages, as well as innumerable articles in magazines, including the monthly PiKappa, which focused on “mysterious archaeology,” a publication that he created and directed between 1972 and 1973.1 In fact Kolosimo produced and propagated a “soft” version of the genre in which he only hints at “ancient aliens,” frequently but generally lacking specific details, within texts bordered on popular science as it is properly understood. In other words, Kolosimo used the references to “ancient astronauts” as a device to spice up his main subject (such as archaeology, history, space exploration, and rocket science) and remained vague in order to conceal the fact that-as confirmed by his acquaintances-he did believe in the veracity of such narrative, although he was sceptical about present-day UFOs and extraterrestrials.2 Kolosimo stands out for his productivity and is still remembered among UFO aficionados in his home country. His prose was remarkably neat. However, if one takes into account all the Italians who either interpreted the Bible (or other sacred scriptures) in a “paleoastronautic” vein and those who expanded, more in general, on “ancient aliens” and “mysterious archaeology,” considering as well amateurish, self-published ones and those who only published one book, such authors number around 135 between the late fifties and the early eighties (see Pupilli 2015). © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021."

The core of this research architecture is an ""elitecentralized"" science paradigm, in which all kinds of research are conducted around scientific elites. The main properties of the ""elite-centralized"" science paradigm are: (1) The professionalism of scientific research, (2) hierarchization of researchers, and (3) specialization of scientific communication. The professionalism of scientific research means that the researchers are professional and receive economic rewards from their work, which implies the utilitarian nature of research goals. Therefore, the behavior of professional researchers most likely follows that of well-represented scientists and selects the research goals that fit the mainstream of scientific communities. They also hope to become the well-represented scientists in the near future. On the other hand, no one is willing to study the topics that are not recognized by the scientific communities or are highly risky. People avoid becoming marginalized scientists, who are at the periphery of the scientific community with lower economic rewards. The hierarchization of researchers shows two aspects. First, every person in the scientific communities must have a professional title such as assistant professor or professor, implying that they are allocated at a particular level of the scientific professional system, with the corresponding economic and scientific rewards. Second, people in this hierarchic professional research system can move from one level to another. For example, in a so-called ""tenure track"" system, an assistant professor can be promoted to associated professor and then promoted to full professor. This kind of hierarchic professional research system with high utilitarian characteristics strongly enhances the ""elite-centralized"" science paradigm, by which the research resources are focused on the scientific elites and highly productive researchers. The specialization of scientific communication generated small professional communities, in which the specialists communicate with each other in technical terms and relying on prior knowledge. This kind of communication also strengthens the influence of the scientific elites. Furthermore, the specialization of scientific communication results in obstructing communication between the whole scientific community and the general public. The success of this ""elite-centralized"" science paradigm generated a well-developed world with a flourish of technologies; on the other hand, it is gradually evolving into a closed system with high ""involution"". Science is a product generated by fitting both sensual and rational requirements. An ideal science-structure must be a balance between physical and spiritual needs. However, the classical scientific enterprise based on the ""elite-centralized"" science paradigm outcomes has disrupted this balance by emphasizing the practical value of science. Now we need to rebuild an open, diverse and decentralized science paradigm. To reach this goal, the first step is to recover the balance between physical and spiritual needs in science. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved."

The double-blind review system, which enforces author anonymity during the review period, is widely used by prestigious conferences and journals to ensure the integrity of this process. Although the notion of anonymity in the double-blind review has been questioned before, the availability of full text paper collections brings new opportunities for exploring the question: Is the double-blind review process really double-blind? We study this question on the ACL and EMNLP paper collections and present an analysis on how well deep learning techniques can infer the authors of a paper. Specifically, we explore Convolutional Neural Networks trained on various aspects of a paper, e.g., content, style features, and references, to understand the extent to which we can infer the authors of a paper and what aspects contribute the most. Our results show that the authors of a paper can be inferred with accuracy as high as 87% on ACL and 78% on EMNLP for the top 100 most prolific authors. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics"

Not so much emphasis, however, has been put on how this new creative stage and the wisdom gained in a lifetime can contribute to improving the author's personal and/or intellectual fulfilment and, by extension, benefit readers by the sharing of that experience. Since wisdom is a quality often associated with old age, it would not be odd to assume that the lessons learned from life and career can not only lead the artist to a period of renewed engagement, but the sharing of that awareness can also inspire readers to get a glimpse of “the good life”. One such example is the Scottish writer Alexander McCall-Smith (1948). McCall-Smith is currently one of the best-loved and most prolific authors in English, having written more than a hundred volumes, mostly after the age of fifty. Among such an extensive production, this article concentrates on his Sunday Philosophy Club series, featuring middle-aged philosopher and amateur detective Isabel Dalhousie, whose deep philosophical interrogations and intensely human dimension interrogate fundamental notions about ethical living and life at large. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

Previous studies have highlighted the practical and theoretical impact of James on the work of Jung. The present article makes use of detailed research for a deeper look at their theoretical relationship, with a focus on James's (1902/2010) Varieties of Religious Experience. This text, written in 1902, was particularly important for Jung's emphasis on fundamental subjective experience, which he evaluated in the book Psychology and Religion (Jung, 1938/1973). Moreover, we investigate important aspects of dynamic psychology developed by James, which Jung advanced in some of his works, particularly in ""On the Nature of the Psyche"" (Jung, 1946/1975a), an essay included in Structure & Dynamics of the Psyche.We focus on the idea that Jung's acquaintance with James led him to move away from psychoanalysis. In addition, their meeting shaped Jung's view regarding religious experience and influenced the formulation of his concept of the unconscious. © 2019 American Psychological Association."

Hamilton offers a major revisionist reading of the works of Anthony Munday, one of the most prolific authors of his time, who wrote and translated in many genres, including polemical religious and political tracts, poetry, chivalric romances, history of Britain, history of London, drama, and city entertainments. Long dismissed as a hack who wrote only for money, Munday is here restored to his rightful position as an historical figure at the centre of many important political and cultural events in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England. In Anthony Munday and the Catholics, 1560-1633, Hamilton reinterprets Munday as a writer who began his career writing on behalf of the Catholic cause and subsequently negotiated for several decades the difficult terrain of an ever-changing Catholic-Protestant cultural, religious, and political landscape. She argues that throughout his life and writing career Munday retained his Catholic sensibility and occasionally wrote dangerously on behalf of Catholics. Thus he serves as an excellent case study through which present-day scholars can come to a fuller understanding of how a person living in this turbulent time in English history - eschewing open resistance, exile or martyrdom - managed a long and prolific writing career at the centre of court, theatre, and city activities but in ways that reveal his commitment to Catholic political and religious ideology. Individual chapters in this book cover Munday's early writing, 1577-80; his writing about the trial and execution of Jesuit Edmund Campion; his writing for the stage, 1590-1602; his politically inflected translations of chivalric romance; and his writings for and about the city of London, 1604-33. Hamilton revisits and revalues the narratives told by earlier scholars about hack writers, the anti-theatrical tracts, the role of the Earl of Oxford as patron, the political-religious interests of Munday's plays, the implications of Mu. © Donna B.

The Most Beneficial Collaborators (MBCs), who have high academic level and relevant research topics, can genuinely help researchers to enrich their research. However, how can we find the MBCs? In this paper, we propose a most Beneficial Collaborator Recommendation model called BCR. BCR learns on researchers’ publications and associates three academic features: topic distribution of research interest, interest variation with time and researchers’ impact in collaborators network. We run a topic model on researchers’ publications in each year for topic clustering. The generated topic distribution matrix is fixed by a time function to fit the interest dynamic transformation. The academic social impact is also considered to mine the most prolific researchers. Finally, a TopN MBCs recommendation list is generated according to the computed score. Extensive experiments on a dataset with citation network demonstrate that, in comparison to relevant baseline approaches, our BCR performs better in terms of precision, recall, F1 score and the recommendation quality. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."

He is an excellent figure to use as a case study when analysing the specificities and implications of categorising a particular author and their works within such frameworks as ‘francophonie’ or ‘world literature in French.’ In this paper, I examine the contemporary culture industry’s shaping of the authorial identity of Tahar Ben Jelloun, whether as writer or public persona. Specifically, this article considers Ben Jelloun at three particular moments in his career, and examines two fictionalised testimonials, Cette aveuglante absence de lumière(This Blinding Absence of Light) and Par le feu (By Fire). Each of the three moments represents a particular positioning of the author’s identity as, alternatively, Arab, Middle Eastern, francophone, African, some combination of these, or as a figure of World literature in French. The two texts were chosen because, despite their similarities in terms of genre and theme, stylistic differences between the two suggest that Ben Jelloun considered shaped the second with critiques of the first in mind. The positioning of Ben Jelloun at each of these junctures – whether by himself, his critics, his readers, or some combination of these – has profound implications for the way his work is read and for readers’ understanding of the role of the author more generally. © 2016 Taylor & Francis."

Awareness of the disease and of its common occurrence translates into increased probability of putting forward the initial diagnosis and further diagnostics. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate frequency and choice of scientific journals with articles in Polish about celiac disease and their comparison with literature on Crohn's disease for the last 20 years. Materials and methods We used an iteractive search process to identify all articles on database Polish Medical Bibliography (1979-2013) made available by Warsaw's Central Medical Library in June 2013. Articles published in the years 1990-2012, written in Polish and indexed under key words ""celiac disease"" and ""Crohn's disease"" have been searched. Distribution of articles in journals and among the authors has been analysed. Results 462 publications were qualified to analyses with the keyword ""celiac disease"" and 510 with the keyword ""Crohn's disease"". In years 1992-1996 articles with the keyword ""celiac disease"" 3-times outnumbered the works on Crohn's disease. In the first decade of the twenty-first century, a significant growth in number of scientific articles about Crohn's disease was observed. In years 2007-2011, literature on celiac disease measured by the number of publications was nearly half smaller). Ten journals with the highest number of articles with the keyword ""celiac disease"" posted nearly 62% of all publications related to celiac disease. Similar index for Crohn's disease was 60%. Three journals with the largest number of articles about celiac disease are notable for their pediatric focuses. The top-10 prolific authors have contributed to the creation of 55.4% of all publications on celiac disease and 34.5% of the articles about Crohn's disease were co-created by the 10 most prolific authors. Conclusions In the recent 10 years the number of Polish-language publications on celiac disease is invariably small. To sensibilize Polish medical professionalists to celiac disease probably may help:greater influx of articles to Polish language journals,selection of journals focusing not only on pediatrics and gastroenterology. © 2013 Polish Pediatric Society."

Yet, we know little about how these end-user programmers create and share artifacts in repositories as part of a community. Objective: This work aims to gain a better understanding of end-user programmer communities, the characteristics of artifacts in community repositories, and how authors evolve over time. Method: An artifact-based analysis of 32,000 mashups from the Yahoo! Pipes repository was performed. The popularity, configurability, complexity, and diversity of the artifacts were measured. Additionally, for the most prolific authors, we explore their submission trends over time. Results: Similar to other online communities, there is great deal of attrition but authors who persevere tend to improve over time, creating pipes that are more configurable, diverse, complex, and popular. We also discovered, however, that end-user programmers do not effectively reuse existing programs, submit pipes that are highly similar to others already in the repository, and in most cases do not have an awareness of the community or the richness of artifacts that exist in repositories. Conclusion: There is a need for better end-user programmer support in several stages of the software lifecycle, including development, maintenance, search, and program understanding. Without such support, the community repositories will continue to be cluttered with highly-similar artifacts and authors may not be able to take full advantage of the community resources. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Its success was the result of a concerted effort by the leaders of the Benedictine Reform movement to encourage both widespread literacy and a simple literary style. The manuscripts written in this era are the source for the majority of the Old English literature that survives today, including literary classics such as Beowulf. Yet the same monks who copied and compiled these important Old English texts themselves wrote in a rarified Latin, full of esoteric vocabulary and convoluted syntax and almost incomprehensible even to the well-educated. Comparing works by the two most prolific authors of the era, Byrhtferth of Ramsey and Ælfric of Eynsham, Rebecca Stephenson explains the politics that encouraged the simultaneous development of a simple English style and an esoteric Latin style.

The growth of a health profession is dependent on the sharing of knowledge. Various metrics have been used to measure the quality of journals, articles, and authors. These metrics, however, have many flaws. Publication productivity and patterns provide better insights that can guide professional and journal strategy. Methodology Bibliometric data were collected from seven key peer-reviewed, international journals for the medical radiation sciences. These key journals were examined over the period 2009-2013 inclusive (5 years). Medical radiation technologists (MRTs) who had published two or more articles in the seven journals during the study period were further investigated through PubMed and ResearchGate to produce a list of publications (excluding those already identified in the seven primary journals) from the 5-year period. Further analysis was performed on the most prolific authors. Results A total of 969 articles were published in the seven key peer-review journals that met the inclusion criteria. The 969 articles were written by a total of 2,083 different authors. Overall, 80.5% (1,676 of 2,083) of all authors only published once within the seven journals and 110 of these authors were the sole author of their article. A total of 165 MRTs were identified who had published three or more articles.

His works are dealing with different topics such as literary criticism, philosophy and myth, and display a wide range of various stylistic devices such as irony, parody and satire. Especially the art of rhetoric is highly present in his texts. This has been emphasized in different works regarding his theoretical writings. This reflects the importance of the rhetorical handbooks, the progymnasmata, which were flourishing during the Second Sophistic and had a strong influence on Lucian. However, the rhetorical approach in Lucian's shorter dialogues has not attracted much attention. An exhaustive commentary on the dialogues is also missing. This paper focusses on Dialogue of the Dead (28) and analyses the rhetoric used by the figures in this dialogue. It is shown that Lucian - in a playful manner - displays different modes of persuasion (especially logos and pathos) with the help of his figures Protesilaos and Pluto arguing in the dialogue with each other. In addition to this treatment of the dialogue, the influence of the progymnasmata is also discussed. Further, it is argued that the dialogue can be seen as a 'model' for rhetoric in practice. Therefore, the dialogue fulfills two purposes: rhetorical education and entertainment by using myth."

With over 500 peer-reviewed publications, Poldermans heavily influenced the clinical practice of perioperative beta-blockers and statins in noncardiac surgery, shaping guidelines and national policies on the use of these treatments. The effects of fraud in perioperative medicine are particularly caustic owing to a profound domino effect. Many investigators devoted their academic careers to following the footsteps of investigators such as Poldermans. Similarly, funding agencies supported this line of enquiry, incurring significant cost and expense. Most importantly, hundreds of patients were exposed to treatments that may have been harmful in an effort to advance this research agenda. How should perioperative clinicians utilize beta blockade now that a considerable portion of the literature is enshrouded in uncertainty? In this brief review, we reiterate and emphasize basic principles about the indications and administration of perioperative beta blockade. Because research misconduct in perioperative medicine can be so damaging, we present strategies to prevent such events in the future. Without such reform, fraud in research may very well continue.

Motives for misconduct include professional advancement and personal recognition. Accounting academics are under the same tenure, promotion and recognition pressures as other academics; and, without the life-and-death issues of medical research, rationalizing misconduct in accounting research seems much easier. It is reasonable to assume that dishonesty has occurred, even if little evidence exists about its prevalence. Further, accounting research can influence tax policy and market conditions, affecting people’s lives. This study is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to survey accounting researchers directly as to their ethical practices; it uses the randomized response technique of addressing sensitive questions. To maximize its relevance to the most respected accounting research, this questionnaire was sent only to the most prolific researchers at U.S. colleges and universities—those who have published in the ‘top thirty’ accounting journals. The results indicate that serious misconduct has occurred among these established accounting researchers. The estimated percentage of seriously tainted articles in the top thirty accounting journals, based on self-reporting, is about 4 per cent, while the respondents on average believe that about 21 per cent of the literature is tainted. Faculty who were tenured more recently provide higher estimates of the falsification rate, and attribute more of the cause to external factors like tenure pressure.

The body of published work by an author or group of authors in a given field may be represented as a vocabulary based on language use. Using vector space modeling, publications may be represented as vectors, resulting in a topic space. The works of a given author may be mapped onto the space, resulting in an author space. The density of a given author space provides an indication of the coherence of the author's body of work, where a high density author space is indicative of a more focused research agenda and a low density author space indicates more varied areas of investigation or language use. This concept was applied to a set of publications appearing in eight high impact factor journals in information science from which the 100 most prolific authors were identified. Their author space characteristics were determined and compared to identify those with the most focused research. The findings demonstrate significant correlations in authors' numbers of publications, vocabulary usage, and resulting author space density, with some exceptions.

She insisted on pursuing a career even though her wealthy family could have provided her with a lifetime of leisure. Because she was a woman, this choice to work outside her home was all the more unusual. Nightingale was also a vanguard woman because she chose nursing, a role that was considered the work of desperate, impoverished women who lived on the street like prostitutes. In addition to these unusual choices, Nightingale’s career was unique beyond anyone in her time. She was one of the most prolific authors of the 19th century. In addition to being an early role model for nursing, Nightingale was also a leader in several other fields emerging in her time, including social work, statistical analysis, and print journalism. As a global thinker, Nightingale would have loved 21st century. She noted cultural, social, and economic concerns, particularly in relation to health and to the discipline of nursing. She urged nurses to progress in their practice and to think outside their official domains. She responded to the culture of the 19th century by envisioning what could be changed. Working with her talents and available resources, she evolved the health care culture of the 20th century and beyond. She called all of this work “Health-Nursing.” As we remember and further study the extraordinary panorama that is our Nightingale legacy, we are creating and shaping our relevant, emerging 21st century nursing practice. © 2010, AHNA.

Although he appears to be one of the forerunners and undoubtedly one of the initiators of contemporary heterodox schools, such as the Ecole Francaise de la Régulation, he is still very likely one of the most prolific authors of this century. His theory of investment and, in particular, the way in which he suggests handling risk and uncertainty is extremely relevant to understanding the depression that transitional economies have experienced. The case of Russia amply illustrates this thesis. It prompts the presentation of a model combining Kaleckian developments with a number of institutionalist instincts to achieve a better understanding of the macro- and micro-economic effects of budget adjustment, as advocated by the international organisations. It is then easier to understand how the prescripts of the dominant economy were able to lead to social economic disaster and how prescripts close to Kalecki's thinking could have avoided that calamity."

This mechanism answers queries for what we call context-sensitive prefix search and completion: given a set of documents and a word range, compute all words from that range which are contained in one of the given documents, as well as those of the given documents which contain a word from the given range. Among the supported features are: (i) automatic query completion, for example, find all completions of the prefix ""seman"" that occur in the context of the word ""ontology"", as well as the best hits for any such completion; (ii) semi-structured (XML) retrieval, for example, find all emailmessages with ""dbworld"" in the subject line; (iii) semantic search, for example, find all politicians which had a private audience with the pope; (iv) DB-style joins and grouping, for example, find the most prolific authors with at least one paper in both ""SIGMOD"" and ""SIGIR""; and (v) arbitrary combinations of these. The prefix search and completion mechanism of Complete- Search is realized via a novel kind of index data structure, which enables subsecond query processing times for collections up to a terabyte of data, on a single PC.

Methods: The authors sampled 172 articles published by authors from the University of Granada Medical School between 1987 and 1996 and analyzed the variations in how each of their names was indexed in Science Citation Index (SCI), MEDLINE, and Índice Médico Español (IME). The number and types of variants that appeared for each author's name were recorded and compared across databases to identify inconsistencies in indexing practices. We analyzed the relationship between variability (number of variants of an author's name) and productivity (number of items the name was associated with as an author), the consequences for retrieval of information, and the most frequent indexing structures used for Spanish names. Results: The proportion of authors who appeared under more then one name was 48.1% in SCI, 50.7% in MEDLINE, and 69.0% in IME. Productivity correlated directly with variability: more than 50% of the authors listed on five to ten items appeared under more than one name in any given database, and close to 100% of the authors listed on more than ten items appeared under two or more variants. Productivity correlated inversely with retrievability: as the number of variants for a name increased, the number of items retrieved under each variant decreased. For the most highly productive authors, the number of items retrieved under each variant tended toward one. The most frequent indexing methods varied between databases. In MEDLINE and IME, names were indexed correctly as ""first surname second surname, first name initial middle name initial"" (if present) in 41.7% and 49.5% of the records, respectively. However, in SCI, the most frequent method was ""first surname, first name initial second name initial"" (48.0% of the records) and first surname and second surname run together, first name initial (18.3%)."

He was also part of the ruling elite at Rome during a tumultuous quarter-century, and one of the most self-revealing of ancient figures. He has, as a consequence, multiple characters: a heroic defender of freedom; a political failure, blinded by vanity and oblivious to change; the epitome of oratorical brilliance; the supreme model of Latin; and a human, to whose weaknesses and foibles we have unmediated access. All these Ciceros, and many others, are discussed in this Companion, though its focus throughout is on the textual Cicero. This is the manifestation that has dominated his subsequent reception. Moreover, any attempt to assess his importance as a political figure during his lifetime demands engagement with the complexities of late Republican politics in a manner that is beyond this volume's scope.

To understand whether this reï¬ ects seismology more generally, we investigate women's authorship of peer-reviewed publications, a key factor in career advancement. Building upon open-source tools for web-scraping, we create a database of bibliographic information for seismological articles published in 14 international journals from 2010 to 2020. We use the probabilities of author names being either male- or female-gendered to analyse the representation of women authors in terms of author position and subsequently per journal, year, and publication productivity. The results indicate that (1) the overall probability of the first (last) author being female is 0.28 (0.19); (2) with the calculated rate of increase from 2010 to 2020, equal probabilities of female and male authorship would be reached towards the end of the century; (3) compared to the overall probability of male authorship (0.76), single-authored papers in our database are disproportionately published by male authors (with a probability of 0.83); (4) female representation decreases among highly productive authors; and (5) rather than being random, the composition of authorship appears to be influenced by gender - firstly, all-male author teams are more common than what would be expected if teams were composed randomly; secondly, the probability that first or co-authors are female increases when the last author is female, but first female authors have a low probability of working with female co-authors.  © Author(s) 2023.

Taking various forms and intensities, the mentor–mentee relationship is integral to this process. The paper therefore addresses the temporal patterns of scientific collaboration between mentors and mentees, as well as among co-mentors, given that understanding the characteristics of mentoring collaborations is essential for developing successful higher education strategies for attracting potential doctoral students and designing effective science policies. Patterns of collaboration were identified using a symbolic data clustering approach and described using linear discriminant analysis. The data come from national information systems in Slovenia and cover the period between 1991 and 2020. On the mentor–mentee level, six types of scientific collaborations were identified and classified in three broader categories: study-limited, already established, and born and raised. The most common, born and raised, is characterized by students who are isolated from the scientific community at the beginning of their studies and have become well integrated into the scientific community and highly productive researchers by the time they complete their doctoral studies. The study-limited collaboration pattern is becoming increasingly popular and more common in the natural and technical sciences. The already established is more common among older mentees. The notion that mentoring promotes long-term scientific collaboration between mentors is not confirmed by the presented study. However, higher levels of collaboration between mentors are associated with younger age, working in the same scientific discipline, and younger mentors. © The Author(s) 2024."

These are the Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics reported by distinguished and experienced researchers, vectorless DNA transfer and incorporation of bacterial DNA into chromosomes of plants years before vector construction of genetically modified plants was invented, water with memory of immunoglobulin IgE, a new electromagnetic radiation method for identifying bacterial and viral pathogens by the discoverer of human immunodeficiency virus, and the claim of isolation of a new bacterial isolate with arsenic replacing phosphorus in DNA. These examples represent very dissimilar areas, and the only common factor is hubris on the part of experienced researchers. Secondarily, failure of peer review sometimes happens, and journal editors do not step in, sometimes even when alerted before publication. These failures of the publishing process teach us that unnecessary mistakes occur and should warn us all to watch our own enthusiasms. Five examples of bad mistakes in published microbiology, immunology and virology reports are discussed in terms of what went wrong and why. © 2014 Federation of European Microbiological Societies."
